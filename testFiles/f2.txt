often used by the Founders, is the process by which meanings are assigned to
words in a constitution, to enable legal decisions to be made that are justified
by it. Some scholars distinguish between "interpretation" â€” assigning meanings
based on the meanings in other usages of the terms by those the writers and
their readers had probably read, and "construction" â€” inferring the meaning from
a broader set of evidence, such as the structure of the complete document from
which one can discern the function of various parts, discussion by the drafters
or ratifiers during debate leading to adoption ("legislative history"), the
background of controversies in which the terms were used that indicate the
concerns and expectations of the drafters and ratifiers, alternative wordings
and their meanings accepted or rejected at different points in development, and
indications of meanings that can be inferred from what is not said, among other
methods of analysis.

There is also a question of whether the meanings should be taken from the public
meanings shared among the literate populace, the private meanings used among the
drafters and ratifiers that might not have been widely shared, or the public
legal meanings of terms that were best known by more advanced legal scholars of
the time. Most of the U.S. Constitution appears to have been written to be
understood by ordinary people of that era, although people then were much more
literate in the law than people are now. However, many of its words and phrases
are fairly deep legal terms that were only well understood by a few of the
legally educated Founders, even though the general population probably had a
rudimentary understanding of them.

There is a problem with the "original public meaning" formulation, because while the meanings of constitutional terms were "public" in the sense that they were not "private" or "secret", they were not necessarily familiar to ordinary people of the era. More accurate would be "legally educated and still learning public meaning", because many of the Founders themselves used terms that they had to research to find the meanings of. An example of this can be seen in the comments by Dickenson in the Federal Convention Aug. 29, 1787, about ex post facto only applying to criminal cases, after researching the topic in Blackstone's Commentaries. So since we can presume the Founders mostly agreed on the writers they considered authoritative on legal usages, we can reasonably refer to the writings of those other writers to find the meanings the Founders intended even if the Founders themselves had not yet done the research to fully master the concepts.

For constitutional terms the denotata are not empirical objects so much as ideas, that is, mental models, that do not, for the most part, have the advantage of some formal scientific models of being representable in mathematical or computer formalisms that we can examine externally. In particular, they are ideas that existed in the minds of persons long dead, so we have to develop mental models of their mental models ("theory of mind") based on the things they read and wrote. That can be done. The verification comes with being able to predict what one of them will say in a writing one hasn't read yet. Becoming adept at doing so can reassure one that one has "gotten into their heads". But that is not something one can demonstrate to others.

This leads to the admonition that the English used in the Constitution and other
legal documents of the 18th century should be read as a foreign language,
putting aside today's meanings of what seem to be the same words we use today,
and attempting to decode the meanings from various clues we can find. This is
not only wise for 18th century English, but for almost any communications, even
among people who communicate with one another daily, because no two people mean
precisely the same thing by the same words on every occasion. When both speaker
and listener are alive they are able to interrogate one another to arrive at a
common meaning, but when the author is dead we have to find evidence in other
things he or his correspondents wrote.

Constitutional controversies are about whether an official act is consistent with, and authorized by, a constitution or constitutional statute or court decision. Since a constitution is a law, and the supreme law within its domain, and authorizes statutes and other official acts which have a textual expression, the principles of constitutional interpretation are essentially the same as the principles of statutory or judicial interpretation.

Most legal scholars recognize seven main methods of judicial decisionmaking:
textual, historical, functional, doctrinal, prudential, equitable,
and natural, although they may differ on what each includes, and
there is some overlap among them.

   1. Textual. Decision based on the actual words of the written
     law, if the meaning of the words is unambiguous. Since a law is
     a command, then it must mean what it meant to the lawgiver,
     and if the meaning of the words used in it have changed since it
     was issued, then textual analysis must be of the words as
     understood by the lawgiver, which for a constitution would be
     the understanding of the ratifying convention or, if that is
     unclear, of the drafters. Some Latin maxims: A verbis legis
     non est recedendum. From the words of the law there is not
     any departure. 5 Coke 118. Noscitur ï¿½sociis. Meaning of
     words may be ascertained by associated words. 3 T.R. 87.

   2. Historical. Decision based less on the actual words than on
     the understanding revealed by analysis of the history of the
     drafting and ratification of the law, for constitutions and
     statutes, sometimes called its legislative history, and for judicial
     edicts, the case history. A textual analysis for words whose
     meanings have changed therefore overlaps historical analysis.
     It arises out of such Latin maxims as Animus hominis est
     anima scripti. Intention is the soul of an instrument. 3 Bulst.
     67.

   3. Functional. Also called structural. Decision based on
     analysis of the structures the law constituted and how they are
     apparently intended to function as a coherent, harmonious
     system. A Latin maxim is Nemo aliquam partem recte
     intelligere potest antequam totum perlegit. No one can
     properly understand a part until he has read the whole. 3 Coke
     Rep. 59.

   4. Doctrinal. Decision based on prevailing practices or opinions
     of legal professionals, mainly legislative, executive, or judicial
     precedents, according to the meta-doctrine of stare decisis,
     which treats the principles according to which court decisions
     have been made as not merely advisory but as normative.
     Some Latin maxims are: Argumentum ï¿½simili valet in lege.
     An argument from a like case avails in law. Coke, Littleton,
     191. Consuetudo et communis assuetudo ... interpretatur
     legem scriptam, si lex sit generalis. Custom and common
     usage ... interpret the written law, if it be general. Jenk. Cent.
     273. Cursus curiï¿½est lex curiï¿½ The practice of the court is
     the law of the court. 3 Buls. 53. Judiciis posterioribus fides
     est adhibenda. Credit is to be given to the latest decisions. 13
     Coke 14. Res judicata pro veritate accipitur. A thing
     adjudicated is received as true. Coke, Littleton, 103.

   5. Prudential. Decision based on factors external to the law or
     interests of the parties in the case, such as the convenience of
     overburdened officials, efficiency of governmental operations,
     avoidance of stimulating more cases, or response to political
     pressure. One such consideration, avoidance of disturbing a
     stable body of practices, is also the main motivation for the
     doctrinal method. It also includes such considerations as
     whether a case is "ripe" for decision, or whether lesser or
     administrative remedies have first been exhausted. A Latin
     maxim is Boni judicis est lites dirimere. The duty of a good
     judge is to prevent litigation. 4 Coke 15.

   6. Equitable. Also called ethical. Decision based on an innate
     sense of justice, balancing the interests of the parties, and what
     is right and wrong, regardless of what the written law might
     provide. Often resorted to in cases in which the facts were not
     adequately anticipated or provided for by the lawgivers. Some
     scholars put various balancing tests of interests and values in
     the prudential category, but it works better to distinguish
     between prudential as balancing the interests and values of
     the legal system from equitable as balancing the interests and
     values of the parties. It arises out of the Latin maxim, ï¿½uitas
     est perfecta quï¿½am ratio quï¿½jus scriptum interpretatur
     et emendat; nulla scriptura comprehensa, sed sola ratione
     consistens. Equity is a sort of perfect reason which interprets
     and amends written law; comprehended in no code, but
     consistent with reason alone. Coke, Littleton, 24.

   7. Natural. Decision based on what is required or advised by
     the laws of nature, or perhaps of human nature, and on what is
     physically or economically possible or practical, or on what is
     actually likely to occur. This has its origin in such ancient Latin
     maxims as: Jura naturï¿½sunt immutabilia. The laws of
     nature are unchangeable. Jacob. 63. Impossibilium nulla
     obligatio est. There is no obligation to do impossible things.
     D. 50, 17, 185. Lex non cogit ad impossibilia. The law does
     not compel the impossible. Hob. 96. Lex neminem cogit ad
     vana seu inutilia peragenda. The law requires no one to do
     vain or useless things. 5 Coke 21. Legibus sumptis
     desinentibus, lege naturï¿½utendum est. Laws of the state
     failing, we must act by the law of nature. 2 Rol. Rep. 98. 

Of these, only the first three, textual, historical, and functional, are methods
of interpreting or constructing the written constitution of government, and the
historical and functional methods may be more a matter of construction than
interpretation. The last, natural, is construction (not interpretation) of the
unwritten constitution of nature, or the unwritten constitution of society,
which form a hierarchy of authority, with the constitution of nature superior to
the constitution of society, and the constitution of society superior to the
written constitution of government. The doctrinal, prudential, and equitable
methods are not interpretion or construction of any of these constitutions,
although judges often claim they are. There is an misguided tendency among
modern judges to misrepresent what are essentially prudential or equitable
decisions as constitutional constructions. Too many lawyers are complicit in
this by casting what are essentially prudential or equitable arguments into
constitutional terms. There is nothing inherently wrong with making prudential
or equitable decisions. The U.S. Constitution confers both law and equity
jurisdictions on federal courts, as do the state constitutions. The problem
comes with treating such decisions as establishing precedents, especially
binding ones. It is one thing to treat a decision as a precedent that clarifies
some ambiguity in the constitution, but quite another to essentially insert a
prudential or equitable decision into the constitution as a kind of amendment.
Such decisions must not conflict with constitutions or constitutional statutes,
but often do. Doctrinal and prudential decisions are more troublesome. The
doctrinal method may be compatible with the written constitution of government
if it merely involves clarifications of ambiguities in the original text, but
not when those doctrines depart from original legal understanding, as they
sometimes do.[1] The prudential method may be justifiable as necessary to handle
large caseloads, but often neglect to render justice in particular cases,
especially when they involve avoidance of controversy rather than a desire to
settle all issues brought before the court.

Within these methods, we can, by study of the writings of the
Founders, and the writings they read, elicit such principles for
interpreting or constructing the Constitution for the United States as the following:

   1. The Constitution is the written document. Although it may
     be considered to include the understandings of its words as of
     the time of ratification, it does not include the subsequent body
     of practices or precedents upon which constitutional decisions
     might be based, which may or may not be consistent with it, or
     authorized by it. The written document refers to itself as "this
     Constitution", and provides for only four methods by which it
     may be amended, all of which apply only to the written
     document.

   2. The authority for provisions of the Constitution is the
     ratifications and state admissions. Current consent or
     acquiescence, or lack thereof, to the Constitution or any
     practice, does not affect the original constitutive acts, and has
     no authority, unless expressed through adoption of
     amendments as provided in Article V.

   3. Provisions of the Constitution are mutually consistent.
     There are no internal logical contradictions, except that a 
     provision of an amendment inconsistent with a previous 
     provision supersedes that provision.

   4. None of the words are without force and effect, except those 
     superseded by amendments, unless such amendments are repealed. 
     Except for the statement of purpose in the preamble, every word was
     intended by the Framers to be legally normative, and not just
     advisory, declaratory, aspirational, or exhortatory. Verba intelligi 
     ut aliquid operantur debent. Words should be interpreted to give 
     them some effect.

   5. Rights and powers are complementary. Every right
     recognized by the Constitution is an immunity, that is, a right
     against a positive action by government, and is equivalent to a
     restriction on delegated powers. Conversely, every delegated
     power is a restriction on immunities. An immunity may be
     expressed either as a declaration of the right, or as a restriction
     on powers.

   6. There are no redundancies within the original
     unamended Constitution. However, amendments may be
     alternative ways of expressing equivalent content in the original
     unamended Constitution or previous amendments. More
     specifically, the Bill of Rights added no new content not
     implicit in the original unamended Constitution, except the
     twenty dollar rule of the Seventh Amendment.

   7. The Constitution was intended to define a functionally
     complete and harmonious system. That does not mean,
     however, that all powers anyone might think the nation or any
     branch, level, office or department should have, were actually
     delegated.

   8. Original "intent" is functional, not motivational. The
     private motives of the Framers or Founders are irrelevant and
     largely unknowable, and likely to have been diverse. The
     common law rule of interpretation understood by the Founders
     was to discern the functional role of elements of the law, not
     the private purposes of the lawgivers.

   9. The ratification debates are the best evidence of
     original understanding. The arguments of those opposed to
     ratification are not just the positions of the losers in the
     debates, which some might dismiss as not indicative of original
     understanding. As the debates proceeded, understandings
     evolved and clarified, and positions changed. Most opponents
     were satisfied by adoption of a Bill of Rights, and by
     assurances by the proponents concerning how the words of
     the Constitution would be interpreted, and those assurances
     must be considered part of the original understanding. That
     means that a construction to which the more significant
     "anti-federalists" would object is almost certainly incorrect.

  10. Powers are narrow, rights broad. The entire theme and
     tenor of the ratification debates was that delegated powers
     were to be interpreted as strictly as possible, consistent with
     the words, and rights as broadly as possible, with the
     presumption in favor of the right, and the burden of proof on
     those claiming a power. Potestas stricte interpretatur. A
     power is strictly interpreted. In dubiis, non prï¿½umitur pro
     potentia. In cases of doubt, the presumption is not in favor of
     a power.

  11. Delegated powers cannot be subdelegated. The U.S.
     Constitution vests all legislative powers in Congress, and all
     judicial powers in the Supreme Court and inferior courts,
     except as specifically expressed. Executive branch officials
     may subdelegate but must remain responsible for the actions of
     their subordinates. There can be no authority exercised that is
     not accountable through constitutional officials.Delegata
     potestas non potest delegari. A delegated power cannot be
     delegated. 9 Inst. 597.

  12. The power to regulate is not the power to prohibit all
     modalities of something. It is only the power to issue
     prescriptions to "make regular", enforceable only by
     deprivations of property or privileges, not of life, limb, or
     liberty. There must always be some modality that is not
     prohibited.

  13. Implied powers are only to "carry into Execution" an
     expressed power and not to do whatever is necessary to
     achieve the intent for which a power might be exercised.
     Delegation of a power is delegation of the right to make a
     certain kind of effort, not to do whatever is necessary to get a
     desired outcome.

  14. There can be no common law crimes. They are in conflict
     with the prohibitions on ex post facto laws and bills of
     attainder.

  15. Rights may not be disabled or unduly burdened by
     legislative or executive process. "Due" process is judicial
     only, involving the granting of a petition to disable a right of the
     defendant, with the burden of proof on the plaintiff or
     prosecutor, and with the defendant having at least those
     minimum protections that prevailed during the Founding. with
     similar disablements having similar standards of proof and
     protection.

  16. There is no right without a remedy. Ubi jus ibi
     remedium. There must always be an accessible forum in
     which a complainant has oyer and terminer for any petition. 

  17.  The Founders were learning. "Original meaning" is not just about what the Founders consciously meant at the moment of ratification, but includes what they would discover with further study of the legal tradition they invoked in the words they chose. Thus, they referred to authors like Blackstone and Coke when they were unsure what they meant, and so must we.

  18.  Early practice indicative but not dispositive. Early practice by the Founders may provide evidence of their aspirations in the words they chose, but should not be regarded as perfect expressions of their intent. Practice can represent compromise with practical concerns and may lag behind the ideals contained in the words.

  19.Â Mental models of mental models. Each of us has a mental model of the world that includes a model of the mental models others have of the world. Communication is possible only to the extent that our mental models of the mental models of others are somehow accurate or congruent. When a lawgiver issues a law, a command to others for future compliance, he is relying on others to understand his words the way he does, and those others are relying on him to use words with the meanings they have for them. But words are an imperfect way to convey meanings, and if the recipient of the command cannot interrogate the lawgiver for his meaning, he must try to improve his mental model of the lawgiver's mental model by such means as learning to accurately predict what the lawgiver will write about matters the recipient has not previously read.

  20.Â Find the right level of abstraction. It was common for the Founders to use somewhat more concrete words to mean broader principles. Thus, "press" or "arms" is not limited to the technology of the time, but refers to the general function they served. "Militia" does not mean merely those legally obliged to respond to an official call-up, but defense activity generally.

A more complete discussion of these principles is best done by
reference to Landmark Court Decisions.

This document is a brief introduction to TCP/IP, followed by advice on
what to read for more information.  This  is  not  intended  to  be  a
complete  description.    It  can  give  you  a reasonable idea of the
capabilities of the protocols.  But if you need to know any details of
the  technology,  you  will  want  to  read  the  standards  yourself.
Throughout the text, you will find references to the standards, in the
form of "RFC" or "IEN" numbers.  These are document numbers. The final
section of this  document  tells  you  how  to  get  copies  of  those
standards.



1. What is TCP/IP?


TCP/IP  is a set of protocols developed to allow cooperating computers
to share resources across a network.  It was developed by a  community
of  researchers centered around the ARPAnet.  Certainly the ARPAnet is
the best-known TCP/IP network.  However as of June, 87, at  least  130
different  vendors  had products that support TCP/IP, and thousands of
networks of all kinds use it.

First some basic definitions.  The most accurate name for the  set  of
protocols we are describing is the "Internet protocol suite".  TCP and
IP are two of the protocols in this suite.  (They  will  be  described
below.)    Because  TCP and IP are the best known of the protocols, it
has become common to use the term TCP/IP or IP/TCP  to  refer  to  the
whole  family.  It is probably not worth fighting this habit.  However
this can lead to some oddities.  For example, I  find  myself  talking
about  NFS as being based on TCP/IP, even though it doesn't use TCP at
all.  (It does use IP.  But it  uses  an  alternative  protocol,  UDP,
instead  of TCP.  All of this alphabet soup will be unscrambled in the
following pages.)

The Internet is a  collection  of  networks,  including  the  Arpanet,
NSFnet, regional networks such as NYsernet, local networks at a number
of University and research institutions,  and  a  number  of  military
networks.  The term "Internet" applies to this entire set of networks.
The subset of them that is managed by the  Department  of  Defense  is
referred  to  as the "DDN" (Defense Data Network).  This includes some
research-oriented networks, such as  the  Arpanet,  as  well  as  more
strictly  military  ones.    (Because much of the funding for Internet
protocol developments is done via  the  DDN  organization,  the  terms
Internet  and  DDN  can  sometimes  seem  equivalent.)    All of these
networks are connected to each other.  Users can  send  messages  from
any  of  them  to  any other, except where there are security or other
policy restrictions on access.    Officially  speaking,  the  Internet
protocol  documents  are  simply  standards  adopted  by  the Internet
community for its own use.  More recently, the Department  of  Defense
issued a MILSPEC definition of TCP/IP.  This was intended to be a more
formal definition, appropriate for use in  purchasing  specifications.
However  most  of  the  TCP/IP community continues to use the Internet
standards.  The MILSPEC version is intended to be consistent with it.

Whatever it is called, TCP/IP is a family of protocols.  A few provide
                                  1
 


"low-level" functions needed for many applications.  These include IP,
TCP, and UDP.  (These will be described in a bit more  detail  later.)
Others are protocols for doing specific tasks, e.g. transferring files
between computers, sending mail, or finding out who is  logged  in  on
another   computer.      Initially  TCP/IP  was  used  mostly  between
minicomputers or mainframes.  These machines had their own disks,  and
generally  were self-contained.  Thus the most important "traditional"
TCP/IP services are:

   - file transfer.  The file transfer protocol (FTP) allows a user on
     any computer to get files from another computer, or to send files
     to another computer.  Security is handled by requiring  the  user
     to  specify  a  user  name  and  password for the other computer.
     Provisions are made for handling file transfer  between  machines
     with different character set, end of line conventions, etc.  This
     is not quite the same thing as more recent "network file  system"
     or  "netbios"  protocols, which will be described below.  Rather,
     FTP is a utility that you run any time you want to access a  file
     on  another  system.    You  use  it to copy the file to your own
     system.  You then work with the local copy.   (See  RFC  959  for
     specifications for FTP.)

   - remote  login.    The network terminal protocol (TELNET) allows a
     user to log in on any other computer on the network.  You start a
     remote session by specifying a computer to connect to.  From that
     time until you finish the session, anything you type is  sent  to
     the  other  computer.   Note that you are really still talking to
     your own computer.  But the telnet program effectively makes your
     computer invisible while it is running.  Every character you type
     is sent directly to the other system.  Generally, the  connection
     to  the  remote  computer  behaves much like a dialup connection.
     That is, the remote system will ask you to  log  in  and  give  a
     password, in whatever manner it would normally ask a user who had
     just dialed it up.  When you log off of the other  computer,  the
     telnet  program exits, and you will find yourself talking to your
     own computer.  Microcomputer implementations of telnet  generally
     include  a  terminal  emulator  for some common type of terminal.
     (See RFC's 854 and 855 for specifications for  telnet.    By  the
     way,  the  telnet protocol should not be confused with Telenet, a
     vendor of commercial network services.)

   - computer mail.  This allows you to  send  messages  to  users  on
     other  computers.    Originally, people tended to use only one or
     two specific computers.  They  would  maintain  "mail  files"  on
     those machines.  The computer mail system is simply a way for you
     to add a message to another user's mail file.    There  are  some
     problems  with  this  in  an environment where microcomputers are
     used.  The most serious is that a micro is  not  well  suited  to
     receive  computer  mail.    When you send mail, the mail software
     expects to be able  to  open  a  connection  to  the  addressee's
     computer, in order to send the mail.  If this is a microcomputer,
     it may be turned off, or it may be running an  application  other
     than  the mail system.  For this reason, mail is normally handled
     by a larger system, where it is practical to have a  mail  server
     running all the time.  Microcomputer mail software then becomes a
                                  2
 


     user interface that retrieves mail from the mail  server.    (See
     RFC  821  and  822 for specifications for computer mail.  See RFC
     937 for a protocol designed for microcomputers to use in  reading
     mail from a mail server.)

These  services  should  be  present  in any implementation of TCP/IP,
except that micro-oriented implementations may  not  support  computer
mail.  These traditional applications still play a very important role
in TCP/IP-based networks.  However more recently,  the  way  in  which
networks  are  used has been changing.  The older model of a number of
large, self-sufficient computers is beginning to  change.    Now  many
installations    have    several   kinds   of   computers,   including
microcomputers, workstations, minicomputers, and  mainframes.    These
computers  are  likely  to be configured to perform specialized tasks.
Although people are still likely to work with one  specific  computer,
that  computer  will  call on other systems on the net for specialized
services.  This has  led  to  the  "server/client"  model  of  network
services.    A server is a system that provides a specific service for
the rest of the network.  A client is another system  that  uses  that
service.    (Note  that the server and client need not be on different
computers.  They could be  different  programs  running  on  the  same
computer.)    Here  are  the  kinds  of servers typically present in a
modern computer setup.  Note that these computer services can  all  be
provided within the framework of TCP/IP.

   - network  file  systems.   This allows a system to access files on
     another computer in a somewhat more  closely  integrated  fashion
     than FTP.  A network file system provides the illusion that disks
     or other devices from one system are directly connected to  other
     systems.    There  is no need to use a special network utility to
     access a file on another system.  Your computer simply thinks  it
     has  some  extra disk drives.  These extra "virtual" drives refer
     to the other system's disks.    This  capability  is  useful  for
     several different purposes.  It lets you put large disks on a few
     computers, but still give others access to the disk space.  Aside
     from the obvious economic benefits, this allows people working on
     several computers  to  share  common  files.    It  makes  system
     maintenance  and  backup  easier, because you don't have to worry
     about updating  and  backing  up  copies  on  lots  of  different
     machines.    A  number  of  vendors  now  offer  high-performance
     diskless computers.  These computers have no disk drives at  all.
     They  are  entirely dependent upon disks attached to common "file
     servers".   (See  RFC's  1001  and  1002  for  a  description  of
     PC-oriented   NetBIOS   over   TCP.     In  the  workstation  and
     minicomputer area, Sun's Network File System is more likely to be
     used.    Protocol  specifications  for  it are available from Sun
     Microsystems.)

   - remote printing.  This allows you to  access  printers  on  other
     computers  as if they were directly attached to yours.  (The most
     commonly used protocol is the remote  lineprinter  protocol  from
     Berkeley  Unix.  Unfortunately, there is no protocol document for
     this.  However the C code is easily obtained  from  Berkeley,  so
     implementations are common.)

                                  3
 


   - remote  execution.   This allows you to request that a particular
     program be run on a different computer.  This is useful when  you
     can  do  most  of  your work on a small computer, but a few tasks
     require the resources of a larger system.  There are a number  of
     different  kinds  of remote execution.  Some operate on a command
     by command basis.  That is, you request that a  specific  command
     or  set  of commands should run on some specific computer.  (More
     sophisticated versions will choose a system that  happens  to  be
     free.)    However  there are also "remote procedure call" systems
     that allow a program to  call  a  subroutine  that  will  run  on
     another  computer.    (There  are  many  protocols  of this sort.
     Berkeley Unix contains two servers to execute commands  remotely:
     rsh  and  rexec.   The man pages describe the protocols that they
     use.  The user-contributed software with Berkeley 4.3 contains  a
     "distributed  shell"  that  will  distribute tasks among a set of
     systems, depending upon load.  Remote procedure  call  mechanisms
     have  been  a  topic  for research for a number of years, so many
     organizations have implementations of such facilities.  The  most
     widespread commercially-supported remote procedure call protocols
     seem to be Xerox's Courier and Sun's RPC.  Protocol documents are
     available  from  Xerox and Sun.  There is a public implementation
     of Courier over TCP as part of the user-contributed software with
     Berkeley  4.3.   An implementation of RPC was posted to Usenet by
     Sun, and also appears as part of  the  user-contributed  software
     with Berkeley 4.3.)

   - name  servers.    In  large  installations, there are a number of
     different collections of names that have to  be  managed.    This
     includes  users  and their passwords, names and network addresses
     for computers, and accounts.  It becomes  very  tedious  to  keep
     this data up to date on all of the computers.  Thus the databases
     are kept on a small number of systems.  Other systems access  the
     data over the network.  (RFC 822 and 823 describe the name server
     protocol used to keep track of host names and Internet  addresses
     on  the  Internet.    This  is  now a required part of any TCP/IP
     implementation.  IEN 116 describes an older name server  protocol
     that is used by a few terminal servers and other products to look
     up host names.  Sun's  Yellow  Pages  system  is  designed  as  a
     general  mechanism to handle user names, file sharing groups, and
     other databases commonly used by Unix  systems.    It  is  widely
     available  commercially.    Its  protocol definition is available
     from Sun.)

   - terminal servers.  Many installations no longer connect terminals
     directly  to  computers.    Instead they connect them to terminal
     servers.  A terminal server is simply a small computer that  only
     knows  how  to  run  telnet  (or some other protocol to do remote
     login).  If your terminal is  connected  to  one  of  these,  you
     simply  type the name of a computer, and you are connected to it.
     Generally it is possible to have active connections to more  than
     one  computer  at  the  same time.  The terminal server will have
     provisions to switch between connections rapidly, and  to  notify
     you  when  output  is  waiting for another connection.  (Terminal
     servers use the telnet protocol, already mentioned.  However  any
     real terminal server will also have to support name service and a
                                  4
 


     number of other protocols.)

   - network-oriented  window  systems.      Until   recently,   high-
     performance  graphics  programs had to execute on a computer that
     had  a  bit-mapped  graphics  screen  directly  attached  to  it.
     Network  window  systems  allow  a  program to use a display on a
     different computer.  Full-scale network window systems provide an
     interface  that  lets you distribute jobs to the systems that are
     best  suited  to  handle  them,  but  still  give  you  a  single
     graphically-based  user  interface.  (The most widely-implemented
     window system is X. A  protocol  description  is  available  from
     MIT's  Project  Athena.  A reference implementation is publically
     available from MIT.  A number  of  vendors  are  also  supporting
     NeWS,  a window system defined by Sun.  Both of these systems are
     designed to use TCP/IP.)

Note that some of the  protocols  described  above  were  designed  by
Berkeley,  Sun,  or other organizations.  Thus they are not officially
part of the Internet protocol suite.   However  they  are  implemented
using  TCP/IP, just as normal TCP/IP application protocols are.  Since
the protocol definitions are not  considered  proprietary,  and  since
commercially-support  implementations  are  widely  available,  it  is
reasonable to think of these protocols as being  effectively  part  of
the  Internet  suite.   Note that the list above is simply a sample of
the sort of services  available  through  TCP/IP.    However  it  does
contain   the  majority  of  the  "major"  applications.    The  other
commonly-used protocols tend to be specialized facilities for  getting
information  of  various  kinds, such as who is logged in, the time of
day, etc.  However if you need a facility that is not listed here,  we
encourage  you  to  look  through  the  current  edition  of  Internet
Protocols (currently RFC 1011),  which  lists  all  of  the  available
protocols,   and   also   to   look   at  some  of  the  major  TCP/IP
implementations to see what various vendors have added.



2. General description of the TCP/IP protocols


TCP/IP is a layered set of protocols.  In  order  to  understand  what
this  means,  it is useful to look at an example.  A typical situation
is sending mail.  First, there is a protocol for mail.  This defines a
set  of  commands which one machine sends to another, e.g. commands to
specify who the sender of the message is, who it is being sent to, and
then  the  text  of  the  message.  However this protocol assumes that
there is a way to communicate  reliably  between  the  two  computers.
Mail,  like  other  application  protocols,  simply  defines  a set of
commands and messages to be sent.  It is designed to be used  together
with  TCP and IP. TCP is responsible for making sure that the commands
get through to the other end.  It keeps track of  what  is  sent,  and
retransmitts anything that did not get through.  If any message is too
large for one datagram, e.g. the text of the mail, TCP will  split  it
up  into  several  datagrams,  and  make  sure  that  they  all arrive
correctly.  Since these functions are needed  for  many  applications,
they are put together into a separate protocol, rather than being part
                                  5
 


of the specifications for sending mail.   You  can  think  of  TCP  as
forming a library of routines that applications can use when they need
reliable network communications with another computer.  Similarly, TCP
calls  on the services of IP.  Although the services that TCP supplies
are needed by  many  applications,  there  are  still  some  kinds  of
applications  that  don't  need them.  However there are some services
that every application needs.  So these services are put together into
IP.    As  with TCP, you can think of IP as a library of routines that
TCP calls on, but which is also available to applications  that  don't
use  TCP.    This  strategy  of building several levels of protocol is
called "layering".  We think of  the  applications  programs  such  as
mail,  TCP, and IP, as being separate "layers", each of which calls on
the services of the layer below it.   Generally,  TCP/IP  applications
use 4 layers:

   - an application protocol such as mail

   - a  protocol  such  as  TCP  that  provides  services need by many
     applications

   - IP, which provides the basic  service  of  getting  datagrams  to
     their destination

   - the  protocols  needed to manage a specific physical medium, such
     as Ethernet or a point to point line.

TCP/IP is based on the "catenet model".  (This is  described  in  more
detail  in  IEN 48.)  This model assumes that there are a large number
of independent networks connected together  by  gateways.    The  user
should  be able to access computers or other resources on any of these
networks.   Datagrams  will  often  pass  through  a  dozen  different
networks  before  getting  to  their  final  destination.  The routing
needed to accomplish this should be completely invisible to the  user.
As  far  as  the  user  is concerned, all he needs to know in order to
access another system is an "Internet address".  This  is  an  address
that looks like 128.6.4.194.  It is actually a 32-bit number.  However
it is normally written as 4 decimal numbers, each representing 8  bits
of  the  address.  (The term "octet" is used by Internet documentation
for such 8-bit chunks.  The term "byte" is not used, because TCP/IP is
supported  by  some computers that have byte sizes other than 8 bits.)
Generally the structure of the  address  gives  you  some  information
about  how  to  get  to  the  system.  For example, 128.6 is a network
number assigned by a central authority to Rutgers University.  Rutgers
uses  the  next  octet  to  indicate  which of the campus Ethernets is
involved.  128.6.4 happens to be an  Ethernet  used  by  the  Computer
Science  Department.    The last octet allows for up to 254 systems on
each Ethernet.  (It is 254 because 0 and  255  are  not  allowed,  for
reasons  that  will  be  discussed  later.)  Note that 128.6.4.194 and
128.6.5.194 would be different systems.  The structure of an  Internet
address is described in a bit more detail later.

Of  course  we  normally  refer  to  systems  by  name, rather than by
Internet address.  When we specify a name, the network software  looks
it  up  in  a  database,  and comes up with the corresponding Internet
address.  Most of the network software deals strictly in terms of  the
                                  6
 


address.  (RFC 882 describes the name server technology used to handle
this lookup.)

TCP/IP is  built  on  "connectionless"  technology.    Information  is
transfered  as  a sequence of "datagrams".  A datagram is a collection
of data that is sent as a single message.  Each of these datagrams  is
sent  through  the network individually.  There are provisions to open
connections (i.e.  to start a conversation that will continue for some
time).    However at some level, information from those connections is
broken up into datagrams, and  those  datagrams  are  treated  by  the
network  as  completely  separate.    For example, suppose you want to
transfer a 15000 octet file.  Most networks can't handle a 15000 octet
datagram.   So the protocols will break this up into something like 30
500-octet datagrams.  Each of these datagrams  will  be  sent  to  the
other  end.    At  that point, they will be put back together into the
15000-octet file.  However while those datagrams are in  transit,  the
network doesn't know that there is any connection between them.  It is
perfectly possible  that  datagram  14  will  actually  arrive  before
datagram  13.    It is also possible that somewhere in the network, an
error will occur, and some datagram won't get through at all.  In that
case, that datagram has to be sent again.

Note  by  the way that the terms "datagram" and "packet" often seem to
be nearly interchangable.  Technically, datagram is the right word  to
use  when  describing  TCP/IP.  A datagram is a unit of data, which is
what the protocols deal with.  A packet is a physical thing, appearing
on an Ethernet or some wire.  In most cases a packet simply contains a
datagram, so there is  very  little  difference.    However  they  can
differ.  When TCP/IP is used on top of X.25, the X.25 interface breaks
the datagrams up into 128-byte packets.   This  is  invisible  to  IP,
because  the  packets  are put back together into a single datagram at
the other end before being processed by TCP/IP.  So in this case,  one
IP  datagram  would  be carried by several packets.  However with most
media, there are efficiency advantages to  sending  one  datagram  per
packet, and so the distinction tends to vanish.



2.1 The TCP level


Two separate protocols are involved in handling TCP/IP datagrams.  TCP
(the "transmission control protocol") is responsible for  breaking  up
the  message  into  datagrams,  reassembling  them  at  the other end,
resending anything that gets lost, and  putting  things  back  in  the
right  order.  IP (the "internet protocol") is responsible for routing
individual datagrams.  It may seem like TCP is  doing  all  the  work.
And  in  small networks that is true.  However in the Internet, simply
getting a datagram to its  destination  can  be  a  complex  job.    A
connection  may require the datagram to go through several networks at
Rutgers, a serial line to the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center,  a
couple  of Ethernets there, a series of 56Kbaud phone lines to another
NSFnet site, and more Ethernets on another campus.  Keeping  track  of
the  routes  to all of the destinations and handling incompatibilities
among different transport media turns out to be a complex job.    Note
                                  7
 


that  the  interface  between TCP and IP is fairly simple.  TCP simply
hands IP a datagram with a destination.   IP  doesn't  know  how  this
datagram relates to any datagram before it or after it.

It  may  have occurred to you that something is missing here.  We have
talked about Internet addresses, but not about how you keep  track  of
multiple  connections  to  a given system.  Clearly it isn't enough to
get a datagram to the right  destination.    TCP  has  to  know  which
connection  this  datagram  is  part  of.  This task is referred to as
"demultiplexing."  In fact, there are several levels of demultiplexing
going  on in TCP/IP.  The information needed to do this demultiplexing
is contained in a series of "headers".  A header is simply a few extra
octets  tacked  onto  the  beginning of a datagram by some protocol in
order to keep track of it.  It's a lot like putting a letter  into  an
envelope  and  putting  an  address  on  the  outside of the envelope.
Except with modern networks it happens several times.  It's  like  you
put the letter into a little envelope, your secretary puts that into a
somewhat bigger envelope, the campus mail center  puts  that  envelope
into a still bigger one, etc.  Here is an overview of the headers that
get stuck on a message that passes through a typical TCP/IP network:

We start with a single data stream, say a file you are trying to  send
to some other computer:

   ......................................................

TCP  breaks  it  up into manageable chunks.  (In order to do this, TCP
has to know how large a datagram your network can handle.    Actually,
the TCP's at each end say how big a datagram they can handle, and then
they pick the smallest size.)

   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....

TCP puts a header at the front of each datagram.  This header actually
contains  at least 20 octets, but the most important ones are a source
and destination "port number" and  a  "sequence  number".    The  port
numbers  are used to keep track of different conversations.  Suppose 3
different people are transferring files.  Your TCP might allocate port
numbers 1000, 1001, and 1002 to these transfers.  When you are sending
a datagram, this becomes the "source" port number, since you  are  the
source  of  the  datagram.    Of  course  the TCP at the other end has
assigned a port number of its own for the conversation.  Your TCP  has
to  know the port number used by the other end as well.  (It finds out
when the connection starts, as we will explain below.)  It  puts  this
in  the  "destination" port field.  Of course if the other end sends a
datagram back to you, the source and destination port numbers will  be
reversed,  since  then  it  will  be  the  source  and you will be the
destination.  Each datagram has a sequence number.  This  is  used  so
that  the  other  end  can make sure that it gets the datagrams in the
right  order,  and  that  it  hasn't  missed  any.    (See   the   TCP
specification for details.)  TCP doesn't number the datagrams, but the
octets.  So if there are 500 octets of  data  in  each  datagram,  the
first datagram might be numbered 0, the second 500, the next 1000, the
next 1500, etc.  Finally, I will mention the  Checksum.    This  is  a
number  that  is  computed by adding up all the octets in the datagram
                                  8
 


(more or less - see the TCP spec).  The result is put in  the  header.
TCP  at  the other end computes the checksum again.  If they disagree,
then something bad happened to the datagram in transmission, and it is
thrown away.  So here's what the datagram looks like now.

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |          Source Port          |       Destination Port        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                        Sequence Number                        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                    Acknowledgment Number                      |

    |  Data |           |U|A|P|R|S|F|                               |
    | Offset| Reserved  |R|C|S|S|Y|I|            Window             |
    |       |           |G|K|H|T|N|N|                               |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |           Checksum            |         Urgent Pointer        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |   your data ... next 500 octets                               |
    |   ......                                                      |

If  we abbreviate the TCP header as "T", the whole file now looks like
this:

   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....

You will note that there are items in  the  header  that  I  have  not
described  above.    They  are  generally  involved  with managing the
connection.  In order to make sure the datagram  has  arrived  at  its
destination,  the  recipient  has  to  send back an "acknowledgement".
This is a datagram whose "Acknowledgement number" field is filled  in.
For  example,  sending  a  packet  with  an  acknowledgement  of  1500
indicates that you have received all the data up to octet number 1500.
If  the  sender  doesn't  get  an  acknowledgement within a reasonable
amount of time, it sends the data  again.    The  window  is  used  to
control  how  much  data can be in transit at any one time.  It is not
practical to wait for each datagram to be acknowledged before  sending
the  next  one.    That would slow things down too much.  On the other
hand, you can't just keep sending, or a fast  computer  might  overrun
the  capacity  of  a slow one to absorb data.  Thus each end indicates
how much new data it is currently prepared to absorb  by  putting  the
number  of  octets  in  its  "Window" field.  As the computer receives
data, the amount of space left in its window decreases.  When it  goes
to  zero, the sender has to stop.  As the receiver processes the data,
it increases its window, indicating that it is ready  to  accept  more
data.  Often the same datagram can be used to acknowledge receipt of a
set of data and to give permission for  additional  new  data  (by  an
updated  window).  The "Urgent" field allows one end to tell the other
to skip ahead in its processing to a particular octet.  This is  often
useful  for  handling asynchronous events, for example when you type a
control character or other command that interrupts output.  The  other
fields are beyond the scope of this document.



                                  9
 


2.2 The IP level


TCP  sends each of these datagrams to IP.  Of course it has to tell IP
the Internet address of the computer at the other end.  Note that this
is  all  IP  is concerned about.  It doesn't care about what is in the
datagram, or even in the TCP header.  IP's job is  simply  to  find  a
route for the datagram and get it to the other end.  In order to allow
gateways or other intermediate systems to  forward  the  datagram,  it
adds  its  own  header.  The main things in this header are the source
and destination Internet address (32-bit addresses, like 128.6.4.194),
the  protocol  number,  and  another  checksum.    The source Internet
address is simply the address of your machine.  (This is necessary  so
the  other  end  knows where the datagram came from.)  The destination
Internet address is the address  of  the  other  machine.    (This  is
necessary  so  any  gateways  in  the  middle  know where you want the
datagram to go.)  The protocol number tells IP at  the  other  end  to
send  the  datagram  to TCP.  Although most IP traffic uses TCP, there
are other protocols that can use IP, so you  have  to  tell  IP  which
protocol  to send the datagram to.  Finally, the checksum allows IP at
the other end to verify that the header  wasn't  damaged  in  transit.
Note  that TCP and IP have separate checksums.  IP needs to be able to
verify that the header didn't get damaged in transit, or it could send
a  message to the wrong place.  For reasons not worth discussing here,
it is both more efficient and safer to have  TCP  compute  a  separate
checksum  for  the  TCP  header  and  data.  Once IP has tacked on its
header, here's what the message looks like:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                       Source Address                          |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                    Destination Address                        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  TCP header, then your data ......                            |
    |                                                               |

If we represent the IP header by an "I",  your  file  now  looks  like
this:

   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....

Again,  the  header contains some additional fields that have not been
discussed.  Most of them are beyond the scope of this document.    The
flags  and fragment offset are used to keep track of the pieces when a
datagram has to be split up.   This  can  happen  when  datagrams  are
forwarded through a network for which they are too big.  (This will be
discussed a bit more below.)  The time to live is  a  number  that  is
decremented  whenever  the  datagram passes through a system.  When it
goes to zero, the datagram is discarded.  This is done in case a  loop
                                  10
 


develops  in the system somehow.  Of course this should be impossible,
but  well-designed  networks  are  built  to  cope  with  "impossible"
conditions.

At this point, it's possible that no more headers are needed.  If your
computer happens to have a direct phone  line  connecting  it  to  the
destination  computer,  or  to  a  gateway,  it  may  simply  send the
datagrams out on the line (though likely a synchronous  protocol  such
as  HDLC  would be used, and it would add at least a few octets at the
beginning and end).



2.3 The Ethernet level


However most of our networks these days use Ethernet.  So now we  have
to  describe  Ethernet's headers.  Unfortunately, Ethernet has its own
addresses.  The people who designed Ethernet wanted to make sure  that
no  two  machines  would  end  up  with  the  same  Ethernet  address.
Furthermore, they  didn't  want  the  user  to  have  to  worry  about
assigning  addresses.    So  each  Ethernet  controller  comes with an
address builtin from the factory.  In order to  make  sure  that  they
would  never have to reuse addresses, the Ethernet designers allocated
48 bits for the Ethernet address.  People who make Ethernet  equipment
have  to  register  with  a  central  authority, to make sure that the
numbers they assign don't overlap any other manufacturer.  Ethernet is
a "broadcast medium".  That is, it is in effect like an old party line
telephone.  When you send a packet out on the Ethernet, every  machine
on  the  network sees the packet.  So something is needed to make sure
that the right machine gets it.  As you might guess, this involves the
Ethernet  header.    Every  Ethernet packet has a 14-octet header that
includes the source and destination Ethernet address, and a type code.
Each machine is supposed to pay attention only to packets with its own
Ethernet address in the destination field.  (It's  perfectly  possible
to  cheat,  which  is  one reason that Ethernet communications are not
terribly secure.)  Note  that  there  is  no  connection  between  the
Ethernet address and the Internet address.  Each machine has to have a
table of what Ethernet address corresponds to what  Internet  address.
(We  will  describe  how  this  table is constructed a bit later.)  In
addition to the addresses, the header contains a type code.  The  type
code is to allow for several different protocol families to be used on
the same network.  So you can use TCP/IP, DECnet, Xerox  NS,  etc.  at
the  same  time.   Each of them will put a different value in the type
field.  Finally,  there  is  a  checksum.    The  Ethernet  controller
computes a checksum of the entire packet.  When the other end receives
the packet, it recomputes the checksum, and throws the packet away  if
the  answer  disagrees  with the original.  The checksum is put on the
end of the packet, not in the header.  The final result is  that  your
message looks like this:





                                  11
 


    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       Ethernet destination address (first 32 bits)            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Ethernet dest (last 16 bits)  |Ethernet source (first 16 bits)|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       Ethernet source address (last 32 bits)                  |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |        Type code              |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  IP header, then TCP header, then your data                   |
    |                                                               |
        ...
    |                                                               |
    |   end of your data                                            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                       Ethernet Checksum                       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

If  we  represent  the  Ethernet  header  with  "E",  and the Ethernet
checksum with "C", your file now looks like this:

   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C

When these packets are received by the other end, of  course  all  the
headers  are  removed.    The  Ethernet interface removes the Ethernet
header and the checksum.  It looks at the type code.  Since  the  type
code  is the one assigned to IP, the Ethernet device driver passes the
datagram up to IP.  IP removes the IP header.   It  looks  at  the  IP
protocol  field.    Since  the  protocol  type  is  TCP, it passes the
datagram up to TCP.  TCP now looks at the sequence number.    It  uses
the  sequence  numbers  and  other  information  to  combine  all  the
datagrams into the original file.

The ends our initial summary of TCP/IP.  There are still some  crucial
concepts we haven't gotten to, so we'll now go back and add details in
several areas.  (For detailed descriptions of the items discussed here
see,  RFC  793  for  TCP,  RFC  791  for IP, and RFC's 894 and 826 for
sending IP over Ethernet.)



3. Well-known sockets and the applications layer


So far, we have described how a stream  of  data  is  broken  up  into
datagrams,  sent  to another computer, and put back together.  However
something more is needed  in  order  to  accomplish  anything  useful.
There  has  to  be  a  way for you to open a connection to a specified
computer, log into it, tell it what file you  want,  and  control  the
transmission  of  the  file.   (If you have a different application in
mind, e.g. computer mail, some analogous protocol is needed.)  This is
done  by  "application  protocols".  The application protocols run "on
top" of TCP/IP.  That is, when they want to send a message, they  give
the  message  to  TCP.   TCP makes sure it gets delivered to the other
end.  Because TCP and IP take care of all the networking details,  the
                                  12
 


applications  protocols can treat a network connection as if it were a
simple byte stream, like a terminal or phone line.

Before going into more details about applications programs, we have to
describe how you find an application.  Suppose you want to send a file
to a computer whose Internet address  is  128.6.4.7.    To  start  the
process,  you  need  more than just the Internet address.  You have to
connect to the FTP server at the  other  end.    In  general,  network
programs  are  specialized  for a specific set of tasks.  Most systems
have separate programs  to  handle  file  transfers,  remote  terminal
logins, mail, etc.  When you connect to 128.6.4.7, you have to specify
that you want to talk to the FTP server.    This  is  done  by  having
"well-known  sockets"  for  each  server.    Recall that TCP uses port
numbers to keep track of  individual  conversations.    User  programs
normally  use more or less random port numbers.  However specific port
numbers are assigned to the programs that sit  waiting  for  requests.
For  example,  if  you  want  to send a file, you will start a program
called "ftp".  It will open a connection using some random number, say
1234,  for  the  port number on its end.  However it will specify port
number 21 for the other end.  This is the official port number for the
FTP server.  Note that there are two different programs involved.  You
run ftp on your side.  This is a program designed to  accept  commands
from  your  terminal  and  pass them on to the other end.  The program
that you talk to on the other machine  is  the  FTP  server.    It  is
designed  to  accept commands from the network connection, rather than
an interactive terminal.  There is no need for your program to  use  a
well-known  socket  number  for  itself.  Nobody is trying to find it.
However the servers have to have well-known numbers,  so  that  people
can  open  connections  to  them and start sending them commands.  The
official  port  numbers  for  each  program  are  given  in  "Assigned
Numbers".

Note  that  a  connection is actually described by a set of 4 numbers:
the Internet address at each end, and the TCP port number at each end.
Every  datagram  has  all  four of those numbers in it.  (The Internet
addresses are in the IP header, and the TCP port numbers  are  in  the
TCP header.)  In order to keep things straight, no two connections can
have the same set of numbers.  However it is enough for any one number
to  be  different.    For  example,  it  is perfectly possible for two
different users on a machine to be sending files  to  the  same  other
machine.    This  could  result  in  connections  with  the  following
parameters:

                   Internet addresses         TCP ports
    connection 1  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1234, 21
    connection 2  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1235, 21

Since the same machines are involved, the Internet addresses  are  the
same.    Since  they  are  both  doing  file transfers, one end of the
connection involves the well-known port number  for  FTP.    The  only
thing  that  differs is the port number for the program that the users
are running.  That's enough of a difference.  Generally, at least  one
end  of  the  connection asks the network software to assign it a port
number that is guaranteed to be unique.   Normally,  it's  the  user's
end, since the server has to use a well-known number.
                                  13
 


Now  that  we  know  how  to  open  connections, let's get back to the
applications programs.  As mentioned earlier, once TCP  has  opened  a
connection,  we  have  something  that might as well be a simple wire.
All the hard parts are handled by TCP and IP.  However we  still  need
some  agreement  as  to  what we send over this connection.  In effect
this is simply an agreement on what set of  commands  the  application
will  understand,  and  the  format  in  which  they  are  to be sent.
Generally, what is sent is a combination of commands and data.    They
use  context  to  differentiate.  For example, the mail protocol works
like this: Your mail program opens a connection to the mail server  at
the  other end.  Your program gives it your machine's name, the sender
of the message, and the recipients you want it sent to.  It then sends
a  command saying that it is starting the message.  At that point, the
other end  stops  treating  what  it  sees  as  commands,  and  starts
accepting  the  message.  Your end then starts sending the text of the
message.  At the end of the message, a special mark is sent (a dot  in
the first column).  After that, both ends understand that your program
is again sending commands.  This is the simplest way to do things, and
the one that most applications use.

File  transfer  is  somewhat more complex.  The file transfer protocol
involves two different connections.  It starts  out  just  like  mail.
The user's program sends commands like "log me in as this user", "here
is my password", "send me the file with this name".  However once  the
command  to  send  data is sent, a second connection is opened for the
data itself.  It would certainly be possible to send the data  on  the
same  connection,  as  mail does.  However file transfers often take a
long time.  The designers of the  file  transfer  protocol  wanted  to
allow  the  user  to  continue  issuing commands while the transfer is
going on.  For example, the user might make an inquiry,  or  he  might
abort  the  transfer.    Thus  the designers felt it was best to use a
separate connection for  the  data  and  leave  the  original  command
connection  for  commands.    (It  is  also  possible  to open command
connections to two different computers, and tell them to send  a  file
from  one  to  the other.  In that case, the data couldn't go over the
command connection.)

Remote terminal connections use another mechanism still.   For  remote
logins,  there  is just one connection.  It normally sends data.  When
it is necessary to send a command (e.g. to set the terminal type or to
change  some  mode),  a special character is used to indicate that the
next character is a command.  If the user happens to type that special
character as data, two of them are sent.

We  are  not  going to describe the application protocols in detail in
this document.  It's better to read the RFC's yourself.  However there
are  a  couple of common conventions used by applications that will be
described here.  First, the common network representation:  TCP/IP  is
intended  to  be  usable  on  any  computer.    Unfortunately, not all
computers agree on how data is represented.  There are differences  in
character  codes  (ASCII  vs.  EBCDIC),  in  end  of  line conventions
(carriage return, line feed, or a representation using counts), and in
whether  terminals expect characters to be sent individually or a line
at a time.   In  order  to  allow  computers  of  different  kinds  to
communicate,   each   applications   protocol   defines   a   standard
                                  14
 


representation.    Note  that  TCP  and  IP  do  not  care  about  the
representation.    TCP  simply  sends octets.  However the programs at
both ends have to agree on how the octets are to be interpreted.   The
RFC  for  each  application  specifies the standard representation for
that application.  Normally it  is  "net  ASCII".    This  uses  ASCII
characters,  with end of line denoted by a carriage return followed by
a line feed.  For remote login,  there  is  also  a  definition  of  a
"standard terminal", which turns out to be a half-duplex terminal with
echoing happening on the local machine.  Most applications  also  make
provisions  for  the  two  computers to agree on other representations
that they may find more convenient.  For example, PDP-10's have 36-bit
words.    There  is a way that two PDP-10's can agree to send a 36-bit
binary file.  Similarly, two systems that prefer full-duplex  terminal
conversations  can  agree  on  that.    However each application has a
standard representation, which every machine must support.



3.1 An example application: SMTP


In order to give a bit better idea what is involved in the application
protocols,  I'm  going  to  show an example of SMTP, which is the mail
protocol.  (SMTP is "simple mail transfer protocol.)  We assume that a
computer called TOPAZ.RUTGERS.EDU wants to send the following message.

  Date: Sat, 27 Jun 87 13:26:31 EDT
  From: hedrick@topaz.rutgers.edu
  To: levy@red.rutgers.edu
  Subject: meeting

  Let's get together Monday at 1pm.

First,  note  that the format of the message itself is described by an
Internet standard (RFC 822).  The standard specifies the fact that the
message  must be transmitted as net ASCII (i.e. it must be ASCII, with
carriage return/linefeed to delimit lines).   It  also  describes  the
general  structure, as a group of header lines, then a blank line, and
then the body of the message.  Finally, it describes the syntax of the
header  lines in detail.  Generally they consist of a keyword and then
a value.

Note  that  the  addressee  is  indicated   as   LEVY@RED.RUTGERS.EDU.
Initially,  addresses were simply "person at machine".  However recent
standards have made things more flexible.  There  are  now  provisions
for  systems  to handle other systems' mail.  This can allow automatic
forwarding on behalf of computers not connected to the Internet.    It
can be used to direct mail for a number of systems to one central mail
server.  Indeed there is no requirement that an actual computer by the
name  of RED.RUTGERS.EDU even exist.  The name servers could be set up
so that you mail to department names, and each  department's  mail  is
routed  automatically to an appropriate computer.  It is also possible
that the part before the @ is something other than a user name.  It is
possible  for  programs  to be set up to process mail.  There are also
provisions  to  handle  mailing  lists,  and  generic  names  such  as
                                  15
 


"postmaster" or "operator".

The  way  the  message is to be sent to another system is described by
RFC's 821 and 974.  The program that is going to be doing the  sending
asks  the  name server several queries to determine where to route the
message.  The first query is to find out which  machines  handle  mail
for  the  name RED.RUTGERS.EDU.  In this case, the server replies that
RED.RUTGERS.EDU handles its own mail.  The program then asks  for  the
address of RED.RUTGERS.EDU, which is 128.6.4.2.  Then the mail program
opens a TCP connection to port 25  on  128.6.4.2.    Port  25  is  the
well-known  socket  used  for receiving mail.  Once this connection is
established, the mail program starts sending  commands.    Here  is  a
typical  conversation.  Each line is labelled as to whether it is from
TOPAZ or RED.  Note that TOPAZ initiated the connection:

    RED    220 RED.RUTGERS.EDU SMTP Service at 29 Jun 87 05:17:18 EDT

    TOPAZ  .

First, note that commands all use normal text.  This is typical of the
Internet  standards.    Many  of  the  protocols  use  standard  ASCII
commands.  This makes it easy  to  watch  what  is  going  on  and  to
diagnose  problems.  For example, the mail program keeps a log of each
conversation.  If something goes wrong, the log  file  can  simply  be
mailed  to  the  postmaster.  Since it is normal text, he can see what
was going on.  It also allows a human to interact  directly  with  the
mail  server,  for  testing.  (Some newer protocols are complex enough
that this is not practical.  The commands would have to have a  syntax
that would require a significant parser.  Thus there is a tendency for
newer protocols to use binary formats.  Generally they are  structured
like  C or Pascal record structures.)  Second, note that the responses
all begin with numbers.  This is also typical of  Internet  protocols.
The  allowable  responses  are  defined  in the protocol.  The numbers
allow the user program to respond unambiguously.    The  rest  of  the
response  is  text,  which is normally for use by any human who may be
watching or looking at a log.  It has no effect on  the  operation  of
the  programs.  (However there is one point at which the protocol uses
part of the text of the response.)   The  commands  themselves  simply
allow  the  mail  program  on  one  end  to  tell  the mail server the
                                  16
 


information it needs to know in order to deliver the message.  In this
case,  the  mail  server  could  get the information by looking at the
message itself.  But for more complex cases, that would not  be  safe.
Every  session  must  begin  with  a HELO, which gives the name of the
system that initiated the connection.  Then the sender and  recipients
are specified.  (There can be more than one RCPT command, if there are
several recipients.)  Finally the data itself is sent.  Note that  the
text  of the message is terminated by a line containing just a period.
(If such a line appears in the message, the period is doubled.)  After
the  message  is  accepted,  the  sender  can send another message, or
terminate the session as in the example above.

Generally, there is a pattern to the response numbers.   The  protocol
defines  the  specific set of responses that can be sent as answers to
any given command.  However programs that don't want to  analyze  them
in  detail  can  just  look at the first digit.  In general, responses
that begin with a 2  indicate  success.    Those  that  begin  with  3
indicate  that some further action is needed, as shown above.  4 and 5
indicate errors.  4 is a "temporary" error, such as  a  disk  filling.
The  message should be saved, and tried again later.  5 is a permanent
error, such as a  non-existent  recipient.    The  message  should  be
returned to the sender with an error message.

(For  more  details about the protocols mentioned in this section, see
RFC's 821/822 for mail, RFC 959 for file transfer, and  RFC's  854/855
for  remote  logins.  For the well-known port numbers, see the current
edition of Assigned Numbers, and possibly RFC 814.)



4. Protocols other than TCP: UDP and ICMP


So far, we have described only connections that use TCP.  Recall  that
TCP  is  responsible  for  breaking  up  messages  into datagrams, and
reassembling them properly.  However in  many  applications,  we  have
messages  that  will  always  fit in a single datagram.  An example is
name lookup.  When a user attempts to make  a  connection  to  another
system,  he  will  generally  specify  the system by name, rather than
Internet address.  His system has to translate that name to an address
before  it  can  do  anything.  Generally, only a few systems have the
database used to translate names to addresses.  So the  user's  system
will want to send a query to one of the systems that has the database.
This query is going to be very short.  It will certainly  fit  in  one
datagram.    So  will the answer.  Thus it seems silly to use TCP.  Of
course TCP does more than just break things up  into  datagrams.    It
also  makes  sure  that  the  data  arrives, resending datagrams where
necessary.  But for a question that fits  in  a  single  datagram,  we
don't  need  all the complexity of TCP to do this.  If we don't get an
answer after a few seconds, we can just ask again.   For  applications
like this, there are alternatives to TCP.

The most common alternative is UDP ("user datagram protocol").  UDP is
designed for applications where you don't need  to  put  sequences  of
datagrams  together.  It fits into the system much like TCP.  There is
                                  17
 


a UDP header.  The network software puts the UDP header on  the  front
of  your  data, just as it would put a TCP header on the front of your
data.  Then UDP sends the data  to  IP,  which  adds  the  IP  header,
putting  UDP's  protocol number in the protocol field instead of TCP's
protocol number.  However UDP doesn't do as much  as  TCP  does.    It
doesn't  split data into multiple datagrams.  It doesn't keep track of
what it has sent so it can resend if necessary.  About  all  that  UDP
provides  is  port  numbers,  so  that several programs can use UDP at
once.  UDP port numbers are used just like TCP port  numbers.    There
are  well-known  port numbers for servers that use UDP.  Note that the
UDP header is shorter than a TCP header.   It  still  has  source  and
destination  port  numbers,  and  a checksum, but that's about it.  No
sequence number, since it is not needed.  UDP is used by the protocols
that  handle  name  lookups (see IEN 116, RFC 882, and RFC 883), and a
number of similar protocols.

Another  alternative  protocol  is  ICMP  ("Internet  control  message
protocol").    ICMP  is  used  for  error messages, and other messages
intended for the TCP/IP software itself, rather  than  any  particular
user  program.  For example, if you attempt to connect to a host, your
system may get back an ICMP message saying "host unreachable".    ICMP
can  also be used to find out some information about the network.  See
RFC 792 for details of ICMP.  ICMP is  similar  to  UDP,  in  that  it
handles messages that fit in one datagram.  However it is even simpler
than UDP.  It doesn't even have port numbers in its header.  Since all
ICMP  messages are interpreted by the network software itself, no port
numbers are needed to say where a ICMP message is supposed to go.



5. Keeping track of names and information: the domain system


As we indicated earlier, the network software generally needs a 32-bit
Internet  address  in  order  to open a connection or send a datagram.
However users prefer to deal with computer names rather than  numbers.
Thus  there  is  a database that allows the software to look up a name
and find the corresponding number.  When the Internet was small,  this
was  easy.  Each system would have a file that listed all of the other
systems, giving both their name and number.  There are  now  too  many
computers  for  this  approach to be practical.  Thus these files have
been replaced by a set of name servers that keep track of  host  names
and  the corresponding Internet addresses.  (In fact these servers are
somewhat more general than that.  This is just one kind of information
stored in the domain system.)  Note that a set of interlocking servers
are used, rather than a single central one.  There  are  now  so  many
different  institutions  connected  to  the  Internet that it would be
impractical for them to  notify  a  central  authority  whenever  they
installed  or moved a computer.  Thus naming authority is delegated to
individual institutions.  The name servers form a tree,  corresponding
to  institutional  structure.    The names themselves follow a similar
structure.  A typical example is the name BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  This  is
a  computer  at  the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) at MIT.  In
order to find its Internet address,  you  might  potentially  have  to
consult  4  different  servers.  First, you would ask a central server
                                  18
 


(called the root) where the EDU server is.  EDU is a server that keeps
track of educational institutions.  The root server would give you the
names and Internet addresses of several servers for EDU.   (There  are
several  servers  at  each  level,  to allow for the possibly that one
might be down.)  You would then ask EDU where the server for  MIT  is.
Again,  it  would  give  you  names  and Internet addresses of several
servers for MIT.  Generally, not all of those servers would be at MIT,
to  allow for the possibility of a general power failure at MIT.  Then
you would ask MIT where the server for LCS is, and finally  you  would
ask one of the LCS servers about BORAX.  The final result would be the
Internet address for BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.    Each  of  these  levels  is
referred  to  as  a  "domain".  The entire name, BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU, is
called a "domain name".    (So  are  the  names  of  the  higher-level
domains, such as LCS.MIT.EDU, MIT.EDU, and EDU.)

Fortunately,  you  don't really have to go through all of this most of
the time.  First of all, the root name servers also happen to  be  the
name  servers  for  the  top-level domains such as EDU.  Thus a single
query to a root  server  will  get  you  to  MIT.    Second,  software
generally  remembers answers that it got before.  So once we look up a
name at LCS.MIT.EDU, our software remembers where to find servers  for
LCS.MIT.EDU,  MIT.EDU,  and EDU.  It also remembers the translation of
BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Each of these pieces of information has a "time to
live"  associated with it.  Typically this is a few days.  After that,
the information expires and has to be looked up again.    This  allows
institutions to change things.

The  domain  system  is not limited to finding out Internet addresses.
Each domain name is a node in a database.  The node can  have  records
that  define  a number of different properties.  Examples are Internet
address, computer type, and a list of services provided by a computer.
A  program  can  ask  for  a  specific  piece  of  information, or all
information about a given name.  It is possible  for  a  node  in  the
database  to  be  marked as an "alias" (or nickname) for another node.
It is also possible to use the  domain  system  to  store  information
about users, mailing lists, or other objects.

There  is  an  Internet  standard  defining  the  operation  of  these
databases, as well as the protocols used  to  make  queries  of  them.
Every  network utility has to be able to make such queries, since this
is now the official way to evaluate host names.   Generally  utilities
will talk to a server on their own system.  This server will take care
of contacting the other servers for them.  This keeps down the  amount
of code that has to be in each application program.

The  domain  system  is  particularly  important for handling computer
mail.  There are entry types to define what computer handles mail  for
a  given  name, to specify where an individual is to receive mail, and
to define mailing lists.

(See RFC's 882, 883, and 973 for specifications of the domain  system.
RFC 974 defines the use of the domain system in sending mail.)

6. Routing


The   description  above  indicated  that  the  IP  implementation  is
responsible for getting datagrams to the destination indicated by  the
destination address, but little was said about how this would be done.
The task of finding how to  get  a  datagram  to  its  destination  is
referred to as "routing".  In fact many of the details depend upon the
particular implementation.  However some general things can be said.

First, it is necessary to understand the model on which IP  is  based.
IP assumes that a system is attached to some local network.  We assume
that the system can send datagrams to any  other  system  on  its  own
network.    (In  the  case  of  Ethernet, it simply finds the Ethernet
address of the destination system, and puts the datagram  out  on  the
Ethernet.)    The  problem  comes  when  a  system  is asked to send a
datagram to a system on a different network.  This problem is  handled
by  gateways.   A gateway is a system that connects a network with one
or more other networks.  Gateways  are  often  normal  computers  that
happen  to have more than one network interface.  For example, we have
a Unix machine that has two different Ethernet interfaces.  Thus it is
connected  to networks 128.6.4 and 128.6.3.  This machine can act as a
gateway between those two networks.  The software on that machine must
be  set  up  so that it will forward datagrams from one network to the
other.  That is, if a machine on network 128.6.4 sends a  datagram  to
the  gateway,  and  the  datagram is addressed to a machine on network
128.6.3, the gateway will forward the  datagram  to  the  destination.
Major communications centers often have gateways that connect a number
of different  networks.    (In  many  cases,  special-purpose  gateway
systems provide better performance or reliability than general-purpose
systems acting as gateways.  A number of vendors sell such systems.)

Routing in IP is  based  entirely  upon  the  network  number  of  the
destination  address.    Each computer has a table of network numbers.
For each network number, a gateway is listed.  This is the gateway  to
be used to get to that network.  Note that the gateway doesn't have to
connect directly to the network.  It just has to be the best place  to
go  to  get there.  For example at Rutgers, our interface to NSFnet is
at the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center (JvNC). Our connection  to
JvNC  is  via  a  high-speed  serial line connected to a gateway whose
address is 128.6.3.12.  Systems on net 128.6.3 will list 128.6.3.12 as
the  gateway  for  many  off-campus  networks.  However systems on net
128.6.4 will list 128.6.4.1 as the gateway to  those  same  off-campus
networks.    128.6.4.1  is  the  gateway  between networks 128.6.4 and
128.6.3, so it is the first step in getting to JvNC.

When a computer wants to send a datagram, it first checks  to  see  if
the  destination address is on the system's own local network.  If so,
the datagram can be sent directly.  Otherwise, the system  expects  to
find an entry for the network that the destination address is on.  The
datagram is sent to the gateway listed in that entry.  This table  can
get quite big.  For example, the Internet now includes several hundred
individual networks.  Thus various strategies have been  developed  to
reduce  the size of the routing table.  One strategy is to depend upon
"default routes".  Often, there is only one gateway out of a  network.
                                  20
 


This  gateway might connect a local Ethernet to a campus-wide backbone
network.  In that case, we don't need to have  a  separate  entry  for
every  network  in  the  world.    We  simply define that gateway as a
"default".  When no specific  route  is  found  for  a  datagram,  the
datagram  is  sent to the default gateway.  A default gateway can even
be used when there are several gateways  on  a  network.    There  are
provisions  for  gateways  to  send a message saying "I'm not the best
gateway -- use this one instead."  (The message is sent via ICMP.  See
RFC  792.)  Most network software is designed to use these messages to
add entries to their routing tables.  Suppose network 128.6.4 has  two
gateways, 128.6.4.59 and 128.6.4.1.  128.6.4.59 leads to several other
internal Rutgers networks.  128.6.4.1 leads indirectly to the  NSFnet.
Suppose  we  set  128.6.4.59  as  a default gateway, and have no other
routing table entries.  Now what  happens  when  we  need  to  send  a
datagram  to  MIT?    MIT  is  network 18.  Since we have no entry for
network 18, the datagram will be sent to the default, 128.6.4.59.   As
it  happens,  this  gateway  is the wrong one.  So it will forward the
datagram to 128.6.4.1.  But it will also send back an error saying  in
effect: "to get to network 18, use 128.6.4.1".  Our software will then
add an entry to the routing table.  Any future datagrams to  MIT  will
then  go  directly to 128.6.4.1.  (The error message is sent using the
ICMP protocol.  The message type is called "ICMP redirect.")

Most IP experts recommend that individual computers should not try  to
keep  track  of  the  entire network.  Instead, they should start with
default gateways, and let the gateways tell them the routes,  as  just
described.   However this doesn't say how the gateways should find out
about the routes.  The gateways can't depend upon this strategy.  They
have  to  have fairly complete routing tables.  For this, some sort of
routing protocol is needed.  A routing protocol is simply a  technique
for  the  gateways  to  find each other, and keep up to date about the
best way to get to every network.   RFC  1009  contains  a  review  of
gateway  design  and  routing.    However rip.doc is probably a better
introduction to the subject.  It contains some tutorial material,  and
a detailed description of the most commonly-used routing protocol.



7. Details about Internet addresses: subnets and broadcasting


As  indicated earlier, Internet addresses are 32-bit numbers, normally
written as 4 octets (in decimal), e.g. 128.6.4.7.  There are  actually
3  different types of address.  The problem is that the address has to
indicate both the network and the host within the  network.    It  was
felt  that  eventually  there would be lots of networks.  Many of them
would be small, but probably 24 bits would be needed to represent  all
the  IP  networks.  It was also felt that some very big networks might
need 24 bits to represent all of their hosts.  This would seem to lead
to  48  bit  addresses.  But the designers really wanted to use 32 bit
addresses.  So they adopted a kludge.  The assumption is that most  of
the  networks will be small.  So they set up three different ranges of
address.  Addresses beginning with 1 to 126 use only the  first  octet
for  the network number.  The other three octets are available for the
host number.  Thus 24 bits are available for hosts.  These numbers are
                                  21
 


used  for large networks.  But there can only be 126 of these very big
networks.  The Arpanet is one, and there are a  few  large  commercial
networks.    But  few  normal organizations get one of these "class A"
addresses.  For normal large organizations, "class  B"  addresses  are
used.    Class  B  addresses  use the first two octets for the network
number.  Thus network numbers are 128.1 through 191.254.  (We avoid  0
and  255,  for  reasons  that  we  see below.  We also avoid addresses
beginning with 127, because that is used by some systems  for  special
purposes.)    The  last  two  octets  are available for host addesses,
giving 16 bits of host address.   This  allows  for  64516  computers,
which should be enough for most organizations.  (It is possible to get
more than one class B address, if you run  out.)    Finally,  class  C
addresses  use  three  octets,  in  the  range 192.1.1 to 223.254.254.
These allow only 254 hosts on each network, but there can be  lots  of
these  networks.   Addresses above 223 are reserved for future use, as
class D and E (which are currently not defined).

Many large organizations find it convenient to  divide  their  network
number into "subnets".  For example, Rutgers has been assigned a class
B address, 128.6.  We find it convenient to use the third octet of the
address to indicate which Ethernet a host is on.  This division has no
significance outside of Rutgers.  A computer  at  another  institution
would treat all datagrams addressed to 128.6 the same way.  They would
not look at the third octet of the address.   Thus  computers  outside
Rutgers  would  not have different routes for 128.6.4 or 128.6.5.  But
inside Rutgers, we treat 128.6.4 and 128.6.5 as separate networks.  In
effect, gateways inside Rutgers have separate entries for each Rutgers
subnet, whereas gateways outside  Rutgers  just  have  one  entry  for
128.6.  Note  that  we  could  do  exactly  the  same thing by using a
separate class C address for each Ethernet.   As  far  as  Rutgers  is
concerned,  it  would be just as convenient for us to have a number of
class C addresses.  However using class C addresses would make  things
inconvenient for the rest of the world.  Every institution that wanted
to talk to us would have to have a separate entry for each one of  our
networks.   If every institution did this, there would be far too many
networks for any reasonable gateway to keep track of.  By  subdividing
a  class B network, we hide our internal structure from everyone else,
and  save  them  trouble.    This  subnet  strategy  requires  special
provisions in the network software.  It is described in RFC 950.

0  and  255  have  special  meanings.  0 is reserved for machines that
don't know their address.  In certain circumstances it is possible for
a  machine not to know the number of the network it is on, or even its
own host address.  For example, 0.0.0.23 would be a machine that  knew
it was host number 23, but didn't know on what network.

255  is  used for "broadcast".  A broadcast is a message that you want
every system on the network to see.    Broadcasts  are  used  in  some
situations  where you don't know who to talk to.  For example, suppose
you need to look  up  a  host  name  and  get  its  Internet  address.
Sometimes  you  don't know the address of the nearest name server.  In
that case, you might send the request as a broadcast.  There are  also
cases  where a number of systems are interested in information.  It is
then less expensive to send a single broadcast than to send  datagrams
individually  to  each host that is interested in the information.  In
                                  22
 


order to send a broadcast, you use an address that is  made  by  using
your  network  address, with all ones in the part of the address where
the host number goes.  For example, if you are on network 128.6.4, you
would   use   128.6.4.255  for  broadcasts.    How  this  is  actually
implemented depends upon the medium.   It  is  not  possible  to  send
broadcasts  on the Arpanet, or on point to point lines.  However it is
possible on an Ethernet.  If you use an Ethernet address with all  its
bits  on (all ones), every machine on the Ethernet is supposed to look
at that datagram.

Although the official broadcast address for  network  128.6.4  is  now
128.6.4.255,  there  are  some  other addresses that may be treated as
broadcasts by certain implementations.  For convenience, the  standard
also  allows  255.255.255.255 to be used.  This refers to all hosts on
the local network.  It is often simpler to use 255.255.255.255 instead
of  finding out the network number for the local network and forming a
broadcast address such as 128.6.4.255.   In  addition,  certain  older
implementations  may  use  0  instead  of  255  to  form the broadcast
address.    Such  implementations  would  use  128.6.4.0  instead   of
128.6.4.255  as  the  broadcast  address on network 128.6.4.  Finally,
certain older implementations may not understand about subnets.   Thus
they consider the network number to be 128.6.  In that case, they will
assume a broadcast address  of  128.6.255.255  or  128.6.0.0.    Until
support  for  broadcasts is implemented properly, it can be a somewhat
dangerous feature to use.

Because 0 and 255 are used for unknown and broadcast addresses, normal
hosts  should never be given addresses containing 0 or 255.  Addresses
should never begin with 0, 127, or any number above  223.    Addresses
violating these rules are sometimes referred to as "Martians", because
of rumors that the Central University of Mars is using network 225.



8. Datagram fragmentation and reassembly


TCP/IP is designed for use  with  many  different  kinds  of  network.
Unfortunately,  network  designers  do not agree about how big packets
can be.  Ethernet packets can be 1500 octets long.    Arpanet  packets
have  a  maximum  of around 1000 octets.  Some very fast networks have
much larger packet sizes.  At first, you might think  that  IP  should
simply  settle  on  the  smallest  possible size.  Unfortunately, this
would cause serious performance problems.    When  transferring  large
files, big packets are far more efficient than small ones.  So we want
to be able to use the largest packet size possible.  But we also  want
to  be  able  to  handle  networks  with  small limits.  There are two
provisions for this.  First, TCP has the ability to "negotiate"  about
datagram  size.  When a TCP connection first opens, both ends can send
the maximum datagram size they can  handle.    The  smaller  of  these
numbers  is  used  for  the  rest  of the connection.  This allows two
implementations that can handle big datagrams to use  them,  but  also
lets  them  talk  to  implementations that can't handle them.  However
this doesn't completely solve the problem.  The most  serious  problem
is  that the two ends don't necessarily know about all of the steps in
                                  23
 


between.  For example, when sending data between Rutgers and Berkeley,
it is likely that both computers will be on Ethernets.  Thus they will
both  be  prepared  to  handle  1500-octet  datagrams.    However  the
connection will at some point end up going over the Arpanet.  It can't
handle packets of that size.  For this reason, there are provisions to
split   datagrams   up   into   pieces.    (This  is  referred  to  as
"fragmentation".)  The IP header  contains  fields  indicating  the  a
datagram  has  been split, and enough information to let the pieces be
put back together.  If a gateway connects an Ethernet to the  Arpanet,
it must be prepared to take 1500-octet Ethernet packets and split them
into pieces that will fit on the Arpanet.    Furthermore,  every  host
implementation  of  TCP/IP  must  be prepared to accept pieces and put
them back together.  This is referred to as "reassembly".

TCP/IP implementations differ in the approach they take to deciding on
datagram  size.    It  is  fairly  common  for  implementations to use
576-byte datagrams whenever they can't verify that the entire path  is
able  to  handle larger packets.  This rather conservative strategy is
used because of the number of implementations with bugs in the code to
reassemble  fragments.    Implementors  often try to avoid ever having
fragmentation occur.  Different implementors take different approaches
to  deciding  when  it  is safe to use large datagrams.  Some use them
only for the local network.  Others will use them for any  network  on
the   same   campus.    576  bytes  is  a  "safe"  size,  which  every
implementation must support.



9. Ethernet encapsulation: ARP


There was a brief discussion earlier about what IP datagrams look like
on  an  Ethernet.    The  discussion  showed  the  Ethernet header and
checksum.  However it left one hole: It didn't say how to  figure  out
what Ethernet address to use when you want to talk to a given Internet
address.  In fact, there is a separate protocol for this,  called  ARP
("address  resolution protocol").  (Note by the way that ARP is not an
IP protocol.  That is, the ARP datagrams  do  not  have  IP  headers.)
Suppose  you  are  on  system  128.6.4.194  and you want to connect to
system 128.6.4.7.  Your system will first verify that 128.6.4.7 is  on
the  same network, so it can talk directly via Ethernet.  Then it will
look up 128.6.4.7 in its ARP table, to see if  it  already  knows  the
Ethernet  address.    If  so, it will stick on an Ethernet header, and
send the packet.  But suppose this system is not  in  the  ARP  table.
There  is  no  way  to  send the packet, because you need the Ethernet
address.  So it  uses  the  ARP  protocol  to  send  an  ARP  request.
Essentially  an  ARP  request  says  "I  need the Ethernet address for
128.6.4.7".  Every system listens to ARP requests.  When a system sees
an  ARP  request  for itself, it is required to respond.  So 128.6.4.7
will see the request, and will respond with an  ARP  reply  saying  in
effect "128.6.4.7 is 8:0:20:1:56:34".  (Recall that Ethernet addresses
are 48 bits.  This is 6 octets.  Ethernet addresses are conventionally
shown  in  hex,  using  the punctuation shown.)  Your system will save
this information in its ARP table, so future packets will go directly.
Most  systems  treat the ARP table as a cache, and clear entries in it
                                  24
 


if they have not been used in a certain period of time.

Note by the way that ARP requests must be sent as "broadcasts".  There
is  no  way  that  an  ARP  request  can be sent directly to the right
system.  After all, the whole reason for sending  an  ARP  request  is
that  you  don't know the Ethernet address.  So an Ethernet address of
all ones is  used,  i.e.  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.    By  convention,  every
machine  on  the Ethernet is required to pay attention to packets with
this as an address.  So every system sees every ARP  requests.    They
all  look to see whether the request is for their own address.  If so,
they respond.  If not, they could just ignore it.   (Some  hosts  will
use  ARP  requests  to update their knowledge about other hosts on the
network, even if the request isn't for them.)  Note that packets whose
IP  address  indicates broadcast (e.g. 255.255.255.255 or 128.6.4.255)
are also sent with an Ethernet address that is all ones.



10. Getting more information


This directory contains  documents  describing  the  major  protocols.
There  are literally hundreds of documents, so we have chosen the ones
that seem most important.  Internet standards are called RFC's.    RFC
stands  for  Request  for  Comment.   A proposed standard is initially
issued as a proposal, and given an RFC number.   When  it  is  finally
accepted,  it is added to Official Internet Protocols, but it is still
referred to by the RFC number.   We  have  also  included  two  IEN's.
(IEN's  used  to  be  a  separate  classification  for  more  informal
documents.  This classification no longer exists -- RFC's are now used
for  all  official  Internet documents, and a mailing list is used for
more informal reports.)  The convention is that  whenever  an  RFC  is
revised, the revised version gets a new number.  This is fine for most
purposes, but it causes problems with two documents: Assigned  Numbers
and  Official  Internet  Protocols.  These documents are being revised
all the time, so the RFC number keeps changing.  You will have to look
in rfc-index.txt to find the number of the latest edition.  Anyone who
is seriously interested in TCP/IP should read the  RFC  describing  IP
(791).    RFC 1009 is also useful.  It is a specification for gateways
to be used by NSFnet.  As such, it contains an overview of  a  lot  of
the  TCP/IP technology.  You should probably also read the description
of at least one of the application protocols, just to get a  feel  for
the  way  things  work.    Mail is probably a good one (821/822).  TCP
(793) is of course a very basic specification.  However  the  spec  is
fairly  complex,  so  you should only read this when you have the time
and patience to think about it carefully.  Fortunately, the author  of
the  major  RFC's  (Jon Postel) is a very good writer.  The TCP RFC is
far easier to read than you would expect, given the complexity of what
it  is  describing.    You  can  look at the other RFC's as you become
curious about their subject matter.

Here is a list of the documents you are more likely to want:

     rfc-index list of all RFC's

                                  25
 


     rfc1065/6/7
               Simple  Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  A protocol
               to get information from gateways and hosts, to  monitor
               failures,   and   to  reconfigure  gateways  and  hosts
               remotely.  This protocol will  be  the  foundation  for
               network  management  activities  involving TCP/IP.  RFC
               1028 documents the Simple Gateway  Monitoring  Protocol
               (SGMP),  which  is an interim protocol on which SNMP is
               based.  SGMP will be replaced by SNMP during 1988/89.

     rfc1064,1056,937
               protocols for reading mail on PC's

     rfc1062   Assigned  Numbers.  If you are working with TCP/IP, you
               will probably want a hardcopy of this as  a  reference.
               It's  not  very exciting to read, but is essential.  It
               lists all the offically defined  well-known  ports  and
               lots of other things.

     rfc1059   Network  Time  Protocol.   A protocol for synchronizing
               the time on all your machines.  Also allows you to  get
               time from one of the national time standards.

     rfc1058   Routing  Information  Protocol.    Details  of the most
               commonly-used routing protocol.

     rfc1057   RPC.  A protocol for remote  procedure  calls.    Sun's
               Network  File  System is based on this.  The actual NFS
               protocol specification is currently available only from
               Sun.    Sun  supplies a public domain implementation of
               RPC.  Aside from its use by NFS  (whose  implementation
               is not public domain), RPC has been used by a number of
               groups  for  building  server/client  systems  such  as
               remote database servers.  See also RFC 1014.

     rfc1042   IP  encapsulation  for IEEE 802 networks.  This will be
               used for the IEEE  token  ring,  broadband,  etc.    In
               principle  it  seems  that  this  would cover Ethernet,
               since  Ethernet  is  IEEE  802.3.  However  the  normal
               encapsulation used on Ethernet is defined by RFC 894.

     rfc1032/3/4/5
               domains (the database used to go  from  host  names  to
               Internet  address  and back -- also used to handle UUCP
               these days).  This includes protocol standards, as well
               as information directed at people who are going to have
               to set up a domain name server.  Every site should have
               a copy of these documents.

     rfc1014   XDR:  External  Data  Representation Standard.  This is
               part of the specifications for Sun's RPC protocol  (RFC
               1057),  which  is the protocol underlying Sun's Network
               File System.

     rfc1013   X Window System Protocol, Version 11.    Documents  the
                                  26
 


               most commonly used remote window system.

     rfc1012   list  of  all  RFC's  below  1000,  with  somewhat more
               information than rfc-index.

     rfc1011   Official Protocols.  It's useful to scan  this  to  see
               what tasks protocols have been built for.  This defines
               which  RFC's  are  actual  standards,  as  opposed   to
               requests for comments.

     rfc1009   NSFnet  gateway  specifications.  A good overview of IP
               routing and gateway technology.

     rfc1001/2 netBIOS: networking for PC's

     rfc959    FTP (file transfer)

     rfc950    subnets

     rfc894    how IP is to be put on Ethernet, see also rfc825

     rfc854/5  telnet - protocol for remote logins

     rfc826    ARP - protocol for finding out Ethernet addresses

     rfc821/2  mail

     rfc814    names and ports - general  concepts  behind  well-known
               ports

     rfc793    TCP

     rfc792    ICMP

     rfc791    IP

     rfc768    UDP

     ien-116   old  name  server  (still  needed  by  several kinds of
               system)

     ien-48    the  Catenet  model,   general   description   of   the
               philosophy behind TCP/IP

The following documents are somewhat more specialized.

     rfc1055   SLIP (IP for dialup lines)

     rfc1054   IP multicasting

     rfc1048   Bootp,  a protocol often used to allow diskless systems
               to find their IP address.

     rfc813    window and acknowledgement strategies in TCP

                                  27
 


     rfc815    datagram reassembly techniques

     rfc816    fault isolation and resolution techniques

     rfc817    modularity and efficiency in implementation

     rfc879    the maximum segment size option in TCP

     rfc896    congestion control

     rfc827,888,904,975,985
               EGP and related issues

To  those  of you who may be reading this document remotely instead of
at Rutgers: The most  important  RFC's  have  been  collected  into  a
three-volume set, the DDN Protocol Handbook.  It is available from the
DDN Network Information  Center,  SRI  International,  333  Ravenswood
Avenue,  Menlo  Park, California 94025 (telephone: 800-235-3155).  You
should be able to get them via anonymous FTP from sri-nic.arpa.   File
names are:

  RFC's:
    rfc:rfc-index.txt
    rfc:rfcxxx.txt
  IEN's:
    ien:ien-index.txt
    ien:ien-xxx.txt

Sites with access to UUCP but not FTP may be able to retreive them via
UUCP from UUCP host rutgers.  The file names would be

  RFC's:
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/rfc-index.txt
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/rfcxxx.txt
  IEN's:
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/ien-index.txt
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/ien-xxx.txt

Note that SRI-NIC has the entire set of RFC's and IEN's,  but  rutgers
and topaz have only those specifically mentioned above.

** LETTER D70 ***

Hello again fellow GMJ readers.  Lots going on right now here at GMJ.
The first Electronic Print issue is finally out and we have been
overwhelmed by the response.  For those of you who just can't afford
the lengthy download, we have an extremely low price for a
subscription offer.  Check out an ad this issue for all of the
details.

The main theme the last few weeks has to be the 3DO.  Panasonic
released the $700 monster early November and it is taking off pretty
well.  We had a chance to test this money vacuum out recently and we
were pretty impressed.  Check out the Power Switch section this issue
to get all of the hands on test details for the 3DO from the Game
Masters.

You Genesis players will be happy to hear that Mortal Kombat is the
number one selling 16 bit title right now even topping the SNES
version in sales for last month.  Why? I really don't know.  The SNES
version is a much better translation.  I guess this just proves that
MK's blood and gore is what makes it.

You are really going to start to see expanded coverage starting this
issue.  We are still playing around with the formats both Ansi and
Electronic Print.  You probably noticed fact windows in our review
section in issue #32 with a few new pieces of information like megs,
who reviewed the game and average of reviews.  Adding to that, is our
hyper text capsules which will be featured next to random reviews.
These capsules will have game PREviews and tidbits of info.

Don't expect to see GMJ every week anymore, we are changing to
bi-weekly.  The reason is that we can put out a much higher quality
issue in 2 weeks and we have reached a point where it is no longer
necessary to come out weekly.  The Elec- tronic print version will
stay monthly and will come out 12+ times per year.

Those of you reading the Electronic Print version enjoyed some Super
SFII art on our cover done by my sister...I'm sorry.  I really am.  I
didn't want to do it, but Street Fighter is Street Fighter and I had
to do it.  I promise there won't be eight SFII covers with in the next
12 issues! While we are on the subject however, check out some
exclusive Super Street Fighter coverage this issue: All the moves for
every character! (and we even avoided listing those phunky character
profiles.  You know, the ones that tell you how many hours of sleep
Ryu gets before his hard training at the Dojo.)

Hey everybody, before I let you read on, let me remind you to not buy
any new systems until sometime in '95 when Nintendo will release their
recently announced 64 Bit system (which by the way GMJ reported before
ANYONE else) for under $250.....yeah right! Ok, so even if it is so
great, and it is that inexpensive, why am I going to wait until 1995?
Listen, if you are always waiting for the next best thing, you will
never own anything.  I like Sega's approach.  Give us a system when
it's ready, let us enjoy it, and release a new system when it's time.
If I had listened to Nintendo last year trying to convince me not to
buy a Sega CD because their more advanced CD would be here in early
'93 and for less, I would be pretty pissed off right now.

Well, that is it for now.  Enjoy our expanded coverage and additional
sections.

      -  Reny Falzarano  [Da Phunky Pheel One]

Just like Mortal Kombat (but with less hype), Konami's Zombies Ate My
Neighbors was released for the S-NES and Genesis on the same day, so
we here at GMJ decided to run a comparison explaining the differences
in each of the versions.  So sit back and relax, 'cause this is one
wild ride.

Both the S-Nes and Genesis versions share the same story-line; to stop
the hordes of evil from capturing your local towns occupants.  You can
choose to rush into action as either a guy that looks like a follower
of Beavis and Butthead, or a pony tail wielding woman that might be
the twin of Mindy from the tv show "Mork and Mindy".  A two player
cooperative option is available so that you're not alone in this never
ending fight to save your town.

Zombies uses a "tongue in cheek" approach to killing the baddies,
because the weapons you use include a water gun, weed whacker, fire
extinguisher, apples, and other household goodies.  You fight in over
forty levels of never ending mayhem, with some levels including a
local mall, a school, and a maze of hedges.  The enemies in this game
are too numerous to count because they all change according to the
level your playing on.  This unique approach makes the game original,
but there is no attention given to the progress of any story.  The
only real goal is to "tag" the residents of the level before a bad guy
kills them.  The residents are spread out all around the levels, and
each level ends when all the people have either been saved or killed.


S-NES version - 83

The S-NES version and Genesis versions of Zombie both sport the same
levels and the same graphics, but the S-NES uses music and sound a
whole lot more effectively, and the control is be better on this one
as well because of the more buttons used.  The title screen is the
first sign that really shows the differences; the S-Nes version has
the Zombies logo gradually morph into view, where the Genesis version
has very little morphing.  The opening music and voices are also done
better on the S-NES version.

The play mechanics and control are a lot better on the S-NES version
because it's full screen, while the Sega version has a two inch black
bar running along the entire right side of the screen.  Just being
able to see more of the screen adds to the S-NES Zombies, because you
have more time to react to the oncoming enemies.  The graphics are
also larger than those for the Sega version and playing them both
right after each other really shows which is superior.

Not only is the screen size a difference in the two Zombies, but the
music, when compared to each other, is a total blowout with the
S-NES's better sound capabilities destroying the Sega version.  Hooked
up to a stereo system, the Zombies soundtrack booms with some house
shaking bass and some of the better video game sounds on the market
being used.  Real samples of screams and explosions were used to give
a sense of realism to Zombies, while the rest of the game comes off as
a B-movie style game with many cliches being used.

Genesis version - 70

The Sega version of Zombies and I got off to a bad start; I played
Zombies on my S-NES and expected an almost identical version on the
Sega.  I was wrong.  The programmers took a shotty approach in the
making of the Sega version, and I was honestly disappointed with the
whole game.  The two inch black bar is probably the thing that stands
out most as an example of bad programming.  It takes up way to much
room on the screen, and it's only use is to show the score, weapons
left, and a mapping system which shows you where the citizens are; all
of which was done on the regular screen for the S-NES.

Bar aside, the graphics in this game are the same on both versions,
with only a slight color loss on the Sega version being the
difference.  Zombies is not compatible with the six button controller,
which would have been ideal with this type of game.  Assigning
multiple weapons to the top buttons could have added a lot to the game
play.  In the area of sound, the Sega version lacks the same
instrumental quality that the S-NES Zombies had, and the sound effects
seemed to be shorter with a scratchy digitized sound that accompanied
them.  I can understand how the music might be below the S-NES
standards, but allowing the Genesis Zombies to be plagued by a huge
bar really brought this game down.


   Here's How They Stacked Up HEAD TO HEAD :

Overall, the concept and ideas for Zombies showed a lot of originality
on both versions, and the two player option adds a lot to the
re-playability of this game.  But when put side to side, the S-NES
version really outperforms the Sega Zombies in both playability and
overall appearance.  Unlike Mortal Kombat where the Genesis version
had the blood where the S-NES one didn't, the Sega Zombies has no
superior qualities over it's S-NES counterpart, and people who are
interested in buying this game will easily pick up a copy of the Super
Nintendo version over the Sega Genesis version.

Hello all of you GMJers.  If you want to write to us letting us know
what you think of the new version, old version, how much you hate us
or love us, or have any video game questions that you hope to be
published, write to us at the addresses above.  We are trying to set
up ID's for ALL of our writers on these boards, but until we do, just
write to the ID's above.  Everyone sees every letter.  This edition of
Express Mail, we only selected letters strictly magazine related since
the theme seems to be our new version.  Since some of the questions
were really good, we thought it would be a good and simple way to
explain exactly how everything will work.  However, keep sending your
game questions and other such mail because next issue will resume
regular procedures...

*** Slow baud? No problem.
I was on Prodigy and I read some promotional letters from you guys
about the graphic version of the magazine.  I assume it is a big file
and I only have a 2400 modem.  Is there another way to get the new
version?

H. Cavelerio
Westford, Ma

{ Phunky: Just recently we decided to give away the magazine through
{ the mail in addition to the downloads.  All you have to do is write
{ us on any of our boards in which we read mail.  Give us your
{ address and we will send you the print issues monthly.

*** Win-dozer
Why is your new version only for windows? I don't have windows and I
have been with you guys almost the whole time! Now you exclude me?
THANKS A LOT!

Norman Lewis
Boston, Ma

{ Phunky:
{ Hey Norm, CALM DOWN! We reconfigured the whole project.  At first it
{ was only going to be for windows, but we found some better ways of
{ doing the mag.  Now anyone with a PC can view our mag through DOS!

*** But, you aren't EGM!
GMJ rules, don't get me wrong.  But we need some overseas coverage.  I
want to know what's coming, when it's coming and how much it's gonna
be!

Michael Watson
Boston, Ma

{ Phunky:
{ Mike, I guess you will be a very happy camper as you read the
{ upcoming issue of GMJ.  We are expanding into a full coverage
{ magazine.  Look for upcoming game lists, Japanese news, sales and
{ rental figures and a lot more!

*** Recent fan wants pictures
I've been a follower of your mag ever since issue #23, and I've seen
great improvements in both the layout and overall quality of the
reviews.  Your info is out months before the other published mags, so
I really don't have a reason to buy them anymore.  The only problem I
see is that you can't have pictures of the games online.  Other than
that, GMJ is my favorite video gaming mag on and it's free!! Keep up
the good work.

Ben Croxford
Boston, Ma

{ Phunky:
{ Well Ben, your prayers have been answered.  Starting this issue, we
{ have a monthly Electronic Print version of the Game Master Journal.
{ We have expanded coverage, full color pictures, a professional
{ layout and anything else you would find in those other $5 mags,
{ except we are free, and we will be offering even more than they
{ will, including several things that just CAN'T be done with regular
{ print versions.

Hey SFII fans, it's renew your lease on your Genesis...AGAIN! Quite
possibly one of the most amazing feats accomplished on the Genesis so
far is the latest version of SFII from Capcom.  Every year, you think
that the good old Genny is just a little too outdated, but bang,
programming hits a new level and you keep it for another year.  Games
like SFIISCE keep Sega players happy, and the video game market going.

Judging by the name, you may think it is just the Champion Edition
standing alone, however just like on the SNES, the Turbo and Hyper
Fighting options are included.  But unlike the SNES version, the Sega
version packs a tournament option.

When you first snag this cart of the shelf and plug it in to your
Genesis, there is simply nothing that is going to fully prepare you
for what you are going to experience.  Every last animation is here,
perfectly translated to the Sega format.  Choose from any of the 12
characters in either of their snazzy uniforms (depending what mode you
are playing in).  The backgrounds amazingly enough look spectacular
even in the 64 color display.  The smooth parallax scrolling,
simulating 3D effect and the soft textured presentation of the
characters are only a small part of this flickerless phenomenon.

Anyone planning on picking this cart up, should really consider buying
one of Sega's little 6 button controllers to go with it.  Not only
does the controller give you true arcade control for a great price
($20), but it is also the best available controller on the market
priced under $40.  With the 6 button controller, this is the best
playing version of the game yet.  Too bad this game was not made
compatible with Sega's upcoming 4 player adapter, the tournament mode
would have fit so perfectly.

The tournament mode is a great opportunity for you and your buddies to
get together and find out who the real champ is.  There are 2 tourney
options.  The first one allows each person competing to select 6
different fighters to use.  Whoever wins the most matches is obviously
the winner.  This mode is great to show up those 1 dimensional players
who can only use one or two characters.  The second mode, the
Elimination Mode, allows to select from one to six characters.  You
fight one round battles and whoever defeats all their opponents first
wins.

If speed is what you need, you will be exuberantly excited to find out
that just like the SNES version, this version is actually faster than
the arcade since you can choose from a total of ten speeds (no code
necessary this version).

Ahh, there had to be one downer.  The voices.  Although the music is
pretty good the voices and sound effects were completely horrible.  A
disappointing con since we have seen a lot of great effects and sounds
on other previous Genny carts.  I assume this was all due to lack of
memory.  Even at 24 meg, they ran out of room to improve on the sound,
but that is ok because the rest of the game is near perfect.

It's finally here folks.  Many thought it would never come, but it did
and in a big way.  SFIISCE is one of the hottest carts this year on
the Genesis with amazing graphics, control and speed.  Only thing I
can say that is wrong with it besides the sound, is that it was based
on the SNES version, not the arcade.  The characters are small just
like on the SNES and they did not truly add the Turbo
backgrounds...however, this is GENESIS!

        Here's how they stacked up HEAD TO HEAD:

For some nitty gritty comparisons, you should check out our review
last issue of the SNES version, but here are some of the points we
came up with.

o The Genesis version is just as fast with no code needed.
o The characters are animated just as well, and graphics are just as
  spectacular.
o The SNES version has a much brighter and colorful appearance and
  that is hands down a big plus.
o The sound on the SNES version is great, the voices are ok, but the
  both the sound and voices on the Genny version rotted!
o The control was great on both versions.  With the 6 button
  controller, the Genesis version played better.  Using the 3 button
  controller, the SNES version played better.  The music was really
  good on both version, but I have to give the SNES version the edge.
o Both versions offer small characters, and unfinished backgrounds.
o The Genesis version offers a great tournament mode not found on any
  other version.

Ranger-X represents what an older concept along with newer technology
can create and along with it a new realm in video gaming.  Space
shooters have been used time and time again, but Ranger-X from Gao (a
new Sega development team) twists the idea along with a side scrolling
shooter to make a game that is actually original in today's market.

Your character is a huge metal suited figure, equipped with a standard
blaster and a second weapon which can be switched at any time in the
game.  This second weapon has it's own power meter which drops when
it's being used.  An Ex-Up vehicle follows along behind you and can
become a part of you by standing on it and pressing down to crouch
inside the vehicle.  While on the Ex-Up you can choose what your
second weapon is from an assortment of lasers to a flame thrower.  The
Ex-Up automatically follows your character throughout the level, and
with the six button controller, you can control it by using the top
buttons.

Flying is a big part of this game as your main guy can take to the air
because of the engine hooked up to your back.  The engine is limited
to just a few seconds of flying, but with practice, hovering in one
place can make it so you're in the air for longer periods of time.
Your character and the other motorized attackers all animate very
fluidly on screen, and the amount of color and parallax scrolling on
the levels in incredible.  Each level has you going after a series of
targets that must be destroyed before going onto the boss encounter.
Some levels have you going on one set path, while others like level
two have you exploring certain areas to find the targets.

The button combinations are unique in that button A makes you face
left and let's you fire in that direction, while button C faces you
right.  Button B uses the special weapon and up takes you to the
skies.  The backgrounds in this game all use a tremendous amount of
color, and the foregrounds and sprites all use color effectively.  The
explosions are realistic looking, which is a given for a shooter style
game.  The popular use of parallax found in the floor of the Street
Fighter II levels can be found here in level three with a 3-D tunnel
that looks like you're really walking past it.  This might not add
much to the actual game, but it's great for the visual aspect of the
game.

The music is some phunky tunes that fit into this game perfectly.
Listening to this game with a pair of headphones really adds to the
game because it makes you feel like you're in the game.  The
explosions shake the house literally, and the gunfire is represented
with realistic digitized sounds.  Other newsworthy portions of this
game include some software scaling of some enemy ships and at the
beginning of each level a series of lines that represent building
scales and rotates around the screen and scale toward the viewer.

The downsides of Ranger-X include the very hard nature of the game and
the awkward controls that take time to master and to feel comfortable
with.  The good points are the great graphics and presentation of the
levels and the overwhelming sounds that happen during the action.  The
addition of the Ex-Up really improves the game-play of the game, and
the bosses and enemies all seem to come at you at once.  Ranger-X has
some great strategic levels, and is a game for the hard core gamer
that can beat most games on hard.  Along with Gunstar Heroes, Sega
seems to be focusing a lot of attention on action games now-a-days
which means we'll be seeing a lot of good quality games come Christmas
time.  Ranger-X is just superb.

Sr. Jnx-90
The sights and sounds in Ranger-X just blew me away! The Ex-Up rover
was a great idea that can be used as an option in future games.  The
scaling lines in-between levels weren't needed, and the difficulty was
just too hard for most gamers.

Mr. Mojo Risin'-92
This game just simply rocks!! Everything is perfect from the huge
amount of colors to the great sound effects.

Leave all your premonitions and beliefs of what your Sega Genesis can
do in the closet, because Sega has probably destroyed every boundary
of what the Genesis is "supposed to do" in it's newest game, Gunstar
Heroes.  Gunstar is in a league of it's own; never before have a
combination of graphics, sound, game-play, software techniques, and
overall fun been all applied to the same game with such magnitude.

Gunstar Heroes is the newest side-scrolling action game to be released
on the Genesis, and while not having the popular movie names to it or
any flashy ad campaigns, has succeeded in mixing the perfect blend of
non-stop action and game-play into one 8-meg cart.  The on-screen
action can only be described as furious, with as many as ten enemies
on screen at once, and clocked at speeds just under a weighted down
Sonic.  Enemies come from everywhere, and attack from just about every
point of angle on the screen.

At the beginning of the game you get to choose your characters
fighting style; either being able to fire your weapon as you run or an
option that makes you have to stand still while you fire your weapon.
Next, you get to choose which of the four beginning levels you'll
start out at, and then a quick rundown on the level you chose.  From
here on out is non-stop action that has to be seen to be believed.

There are four primary weapons in Gunstar: a laser, a fire thrower, a
seek and destroy weapon, and a flame thrower.  The weapons are spread
out all around the levels and can be upgraded by finding and picking
up that weapons icon.  An original idea used in this game is that the
weapons can be mixed so that a brand new weapon is made (ie.  if you
pick up the fire thrower and the tracking weapon, the weapon becomes a
huge line of flame that seeks out enemies.) This new weapon set-up
makes for some great trial and error situations where you must decide
which weapon must be used in what situation.

Scaling and rotation have never looked this good on the Sega Genesis.
Through software techniques, almost flawless rendering of objects is
possible.  Most of the bosses use at least some special technique in
the way they attack or more around the screen.  One such boss is a
series of boxes in the form of a human figure which rotates around the
screen and has the most lifelike movements that I've ever seen in a
box.  The rest of the graphics in this game are cartoonish in nature,
but are done with superb color usage and some great animations.  A lot
of detail went into the making of this game, with great shading and
backgrounds on all of the levels, and a lot of attention in keeping
the action intense at all points in the game.

The first four levels can be beaten in any order, and doing so is no
cake walk.  Each level has several mini-bosses and an end boss that
makes you use all the skills of the character.  Your character can
shoot in any direction, be it up, down, sideways, or in any diagonal
direction.  Your character can also do a slide sweep which takes a lot
of damage off the enemies, and a combination of a throw or a body
slam/jump kick.  Hanging from ceilings and ledges is also possible,
and aerial throws and combinations are also possible.  Two of the
levels have you riding in a separate vehicle; one being in a scooter
that can defy gravity, and the other one in a spaceship for a mini
outer space shooter.  Game-play has never reached these heights, with
an improvement only possible with the use of a six button capability
not found in this game.  The levels themselves also have unique things
to cling from and to climb on.  One level is set on an aircraft in the
sky while another is a huge monopoly game with multiple baddies to
beat up on.  Older twists such as reappearing bosses has also been
used so that the boss count in this game is over fifteen guys.

Games with great graphics or a lot software techniques usually end up
having one area of the game being less than standard.  This is not
true with Gunstar though, because the music and sounds in this game
are THE best I've ever heard on the Genesis.  The background music
pounds out some hard rock tunes while the on screen action is heard
with some heart stopping explosions and non-stop gunfire.  Every
action has it's own sound effect so your neighbors may complain that
there's a war going on in your bedroom.

One feature that I didn't mention above is that Gunstar is a two
player game also.  After testing it out though, we found that some
slow down was found in some levels because of it, but not enough to
hurt the game in any way.  To add to the replay value, Gunstar has the
perfect difficulty curve that actually affects the attacks of the
enemies (ie.  on easy, there are several "spots" where you can stand
when fighting a boss and not get hurt, but while on the other settings
you can get hurt anywhere.) To me, Gunstar is almost the perfect game.
Everything is done to perfection, with action unequaled in any
earlier attempts at a side-scrolling action game, and that is as fun
to watch as it is to be playing.  Hopefully, more games will be made
with this being the game to match in overall quality and
professionalism.  Goods news for us though, because this game is just
screaming sequel.

Phunky Pheel One-96 Wow!
This game sets new standards for video games in general.  Not only are
the graphics some of the best, but the sounds and playability are up
there with other classics like Contra and Mega Man.  To bad the
creators of this game are working on a McDonalds game and not a sequel
to Gunstar Heroes!

Anderson-90
Gunstar Heroes shows that with a lot of programming a game can surpass
the expectations of a system.  I couldn't believe the amount of action
on screen at once.  The two player adaption was a great addition to a
game that needs no improvements and has the best moves this side of
Street Fighter.

Pepperidge Farmer-97
Perfect man, perfect! I've been playing this game non-stop ever since
the GMJ offices got it in.  The many smiles this game gave me is worth
the price, no prob.  One or two more levels would have made this game
a 100.

GENESIS NEWZ CLIP:
Redo it! The preliminary version of Tournament Fighters from Konami on
the Genesis looked pathetic, however after retooling and refining
backgrounds and animation, the Genny version is starting to look up.
The hyped up Eternal Champions from Sega is one of the best looking
games for the holidays.  The new texture techniques used will be
making this one of the most impressive graphical displays on the
Genesis EVER!

Welcome back all to another exciting issue.
This issue we are featuring 2 special reviews of games that appear on
both the SNES and Genesis.  If you have trouble deciding which
version of a game to get, GMJ will now be doing side by side
comparisons of any game that appears on 2 or more systems.  Next
issue you can look forward to over 15 reviews and a special
Electronic Arts insert reviewing ALL the four way play games, as well
as 2 3DO reviews.

Macromdeia announced recently to develop a player which would allow
Director Macintosh or Windows files to be compatible on the 3DO.
This is the first bid to direct the 3DO as a business utility and not
just a video game console.  Marketing the 3DO directly to compete
with Macs and PC's would certainly strenghten the list of pros for
the 3DO as we here at GMJ are not very convinced that the 3DO is
strictly a video game unit.

In Segaland there is many a rumor flying around about the Saturn.
Sega may ditch the old format and hop right on to a 64 bit project
with the same title which would be a CD based unit that would play
Sega CD format games as well as regular Genesis titles.  Our source
for this rumor was very bleak so that is all we can say right now.
If we find any backbone or followup information to that story, you
will be updated...But for what we CAN tell you right now not to
expect this super system until late '94.  At the earliest.

Any Genesis owner who feels depribed for some reason that only SNES
players will be enjoying the horrible SFII/MK ripoff, Clayfighters
can rejoyce.  Interplay, makers of the SNES game Clayfighters has
singed on to the Sega 3rd party crew with a Genesis version of
Clayfighters.

Some possible last second changes to Sonic CD might be a replacement
of the cinema scenes.  We hate to throw another rumor at you but we
have to.  The grapevine has it that the current cinemas to Sonic CD
will be replaced by segments of the Saturday version of the cartoon.
As long as they don't delay the game because of this, I don't care,
otherwise...WHY?!?!

All of you Sega/health freaks (and those two things are just so
complimantary of each other) can have fun with an upcoming excersise
unit from the company Hearbeat.  This unit plugs into the Genesis
control port and its directional controls are hooked up to an
exersise bike (provided by you).  You setup a workout which will be
interactive with a game.  The concept of the packin game (Outback
Joey) is to go through levels and fight off bad guys while mantaining
a certain heart rate.  There may also be an NHL game in development
for this unique attachment...?

Nearly three weeks ago the long awaited Panasonic 3DO multimedia unit
was released nationwide for a retail of $700.  Available for our
hands on test was one pack-in game wad Crash and Burn - a futuristic
racing game.  For what we had been expecting, believe it or not some
at GMJ were somewhat disappointed.  Before you decide to stop reading
our magazine forever though, hear me out.  The scaling, graphics and
manipulation of the objects and backgrounds was incredible, however
the movement and interaction with the car and backgrounds was poorly
done.  Then we thought it was not fair to judge a first title so
strictly, and when compared to say an Altered beast or Super Mario
World (in ratio), it is needless to say that Crash and Burn is a
king.

I was disappointed in the marketing of this unit.  Thrown in every
video game section of every store, the 3DO is now directed as a way
too expensive video game unit, instead of a next wave multimedia
entertainment business and networking unit and possibly the
replacement for VCR and alternate to an expensive PC that it is.
Instead of packing the unit with a keyboard or control panel, the
system is packed with a video game controller and the "bare" system
is not fully capable of running full length full motion video discs.
A special cartridge upgrade has to be installed.  These are all some
major mistakes because at $700 no one is purchasing this system so
they can play Madden football...and if they are, they got some
problems.

Ok, so you are all thinking how bad we are dogging this unit.  NO NO
NO! Not at all.  I am convinced this will be the entertainment unit
of the future hands down.  The possibilities of the 3DO are endless.
We just thought that their marketing approach was all wrong.  Why
should I spend $700 that is not loaded with some of the standard
features it was supposed to COME with when in 9 months another 3DO
system will be released for $500 with internal full motion
capabilities, a keyboard, and a mouse?

Let there be no mistake.  This IS the future of entertainment.  This
is a video game system, interactive TV, fax machine, VCR and more all
in one unit.

Check out next issue where we will give you a FULL coverage report
and review the games.

Lets get right to the chase gang, this is one HELL of a game! The
game that started the craze, Street Fighter, has it's third upgrade
now, this time with new everything! 4 new characters, redrawn
graphics, re-sampled sounds...  it's all here! NEW MOVES TOO!

Unless you have lived in a CAVE for the last 30 months, you know that
the object of Street Fighter is to beat your foe in a
two-out-of-three falls match.  There are SIXTEEN characters to choose
from, each with their own fighting style.  Some throw fireballs, some
are great with their hands while others are blazing fast.  It is up
to you to find a character that best macthes your playing style.

You play against 12 of the 16 characters when you play against the
computer, and the first 11 are randomly selected.  The final
character you face is M.Bison, the evil druglord/dictator of Thailand
who has spread his evil world-wide.

When someone else puts their credits in the machine, the game goes
into a head-to-head mode.  You then must fight to stay on the machine
because the loser goes home!

One of the Game of the Year candidates, this one will blow you away!

Ace - 95
The ONLY problem I had with this game was the fact that the sounds,
although they sound GREAT with Q-sound, are AWEFULLY DONE! This
sounds like a NEO*GEO game! But other than that..  LOOK OUT!

====================================================================
                             WARP ZONE!
====================================================================

SUPER STREET FIGHTER MOVES:  All of the new ones BEFORE EGM,
                             GamePro, VG + Die Hard Game Fan.

NOTE: Although this LOOKS like some posts on the Internet, this is
      NOT a 'steal', we did find these moves, these are OUR strat's
      and all of these moves are listed correctly.  (IF not, tell
      us, and we'll fix it!)


====================================================================
Cammy
====================================================================
Special Moves:
Spear kick:           |  \  --o  +  kick
                      o   o

Spinning Backhand: /  |  \  +  punch
                  o   o   o

Crescent Kick:  --o  |  \  + kick
                     o   o

Pile-driving Suplex (Pileplex):  --o  +  fierce kick
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Back Suplex: --o  +  fierce punch
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Ariel Throw:  --o  +  medium kick

Comments:
Spear Kick: Cammy launxhes herself horizontally, close to the ground,
at the opponent.  This is actually her worst move, but it can be used
it combos very easily.  The only problem with it is that it has
horrible recovery time.  This can be dealt with by doing the short
spear kick from the limit of its range so that while your opponent is
recovering from the block, you can be recovering from the kick.  It
also places you at the maximum distance from the opponent.  It also
only goes about half way across the screen before stopping.  It can
be used to stop projectiles like Blanka and Honda, but it is best
used as a defensive maneuver.

Spinning Backhand: This looks like a quick spin followed by a guile
backhand.  It has the capability of hitting twice, and when it does
it does a great deal of damage.  Secondly, when Cammy is spinning on
her heals she is invincible.  But you have to have perfect timing,
since you are vulnerable before and after this point.  It can be used
like Balrog's TAP to dodge fireballs, but it is more difficult to
time.  Because you move so far forward, you will probably want to use
the jab spinning backhand, otherwise you will end up within sweeping
distance.  The move is fairly slow, but if used correctly, deadly.

Crescent Kick: This is basically a dragon punch with her foot, and it
is her best move.  It has a trajectory that is wider than Ken's
fierce DP, and it is also invincible (except against Ken/Ryu's Dragon
Punch) while going up.  The intital frames are vulnerable, though, so
it cant be used exactly like the DP.

Combos:
    If Ken or Ryu throw a fireball, do the following...
      Spinning Backhand, short kick, Crescent Kick (3 to 5 hit combo)
    If Guile shows Sonic Boom or Dee Jay shows Ace rusher, do...
      Spinning Backhand, Crescent Kick (2 to 4 hit combo)

Overall:
Cammy is one of the best new characters in the game, according to
most people.  She has good speed and air-priority to rival Chun Li.
She seems to be played in the same style as Chun Li, but with the
added advantage of the uppercut-like kick.  She is great at anti-air
defense, also.

====================================================================
T-Hawk
====================================================================
Special Moves:

Mexican Typhoon:        full 360 degrees on joystick + punch
(aka Phi Slamma Jamma)  (like zangief's spinning pile driver)

Condor Dive:  Jump + (all three punches)

Tomahawk Buster:   --o  |  \  +  punch
                        o   o

Face Smash:   --o + fierce punch

Face Chop:   --o + roundhouse

Throw:  medium punch

Comments:
Mexican Typhoon: Hawk grabs you, plams your head like a basketball,
jumps in the air, windmills you in the air 720 degress, then slams
you into the ground head first.  If you want to impress the hell out
of everyone around you, this is the move to do.  It has a pretty
decent range, about the length for dahlsim to throw.

Condor Dive: T-Hawk jumps, then suddenly dives at you like dahlsim's
yoga spear.  This move can be deceptive - try jumping back, then
diving with the condor dive.  It has a good range, but can only be
done on the way up, not on the way down.  It can be useful for
countering fireballs.

Tomahawk Buster: Another version of the DP, but this goes more
diagonal and is not as quick.  It is only invincible for a very short
time at the beginning, then the rest is vulnerable.  The fierce TB
extends really far - farther than ken's DP - and can also hit twice
if close enough.  It has a pretty nasty fall distance, so it can be
risky.  But the delay when you reach the ground is minimal.

Combos:
Roundhouse neck kick- standing forward- fierce tomahawk buster.

The tick standing short - into mexican typhoon seems to work, but not
as well as Zangief's.

Overall:
T-Hawk seems to be a very versatile character.  His biggest weakness
is his speed, but that can be made up for by his big moves.  His
spinning leg sweep is also a nice move, and it executes faster than
Guile's fierce trip.  His kicks have decent range - much better than
Ken, Ryu, Zangief, and Chun Li's, i would say.  His standing forward
is really nice - it has about a Ryu crouching roundhouse range,
sticks out straight, and is fast.

====================================================================
Dee-Jay
====================================================================
Special Moves:

Machine Gun Upper:   |  o  +  (punch, punch, punch...)
                     o  |

Ace Rusher:  --o  +  punch
             (charge)

Hop Step and a Kick:     o--   --o  +  kick
                       (charge?)

Dee Jay Escape:    | + roundhouse kick
                   o
Comments:
Machine Gun Upper: If you hit the button once, you get a jab-like
uppercut.  Tapping a punch button repeatedly after executin the move
will extend the punch further.  It works well as a defensive move, as
it will stop most characters from jumping in.  It is difficult to hit
more than a few times, but it has been done up to four.

Ace Rusher: This looks and works like guile's sonic boom, but is
different because it has a long recovery time and his body leans way
forward when performing it.

Hop Step and a Kick: He sort of kicks, turns around, and kicks again.
Crouching Roundhouse: This is like dahlsim's slide.  It can be used
against someone who is jumping in at you, but unfortunately it cant
go under fireballs.  If the timing is right, you can follow up a
fireball with this.

Combos:
   jumping hit - standing forward - fireball
   jumping hit - standing short - short spinning kick

Overall:
Dee Jay seems to be one of the better characters and will be
especially useful to those who know how to use Guile.  His far
standing fierce is a good anty-air attack, and his jump + roundhouse
hits far enough down to hit Dahlsim's crouching fierce.  His jumps
are his biggest flaw.  The lower part of his body hangs really low,
which makes it hard to jump over fireballs.  Fireball traps seem to
work very well against him, since jumping is difficult and he lacks
any invincible move.

====================================================================
Fei Long
====================================================================

Special Moves:

Triple Punch:   |  \  --o  +  punch (repeat,
                o   o                repeat...)

Flaming Vertical Kick:   o--  |   /  +  kick
                              o  o

Leaping Double Kick:   --o  +  roundhouse

Flip-over throw:   --o +  roundhouse
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Comments:
Triple Punch: Doing the fireball motion once will give you a flaming
jab.  Doing it again quickly will cause him to slide forward a bit
and follow up with a straight punch.  A third time finishes the move
with another punch.  He rushes at you faster than Balrog's rushing
punches, but it is hard to get the timing right to get multiple hits.
Practice makes perfect!

Flaming Kick: He jumps into the air with his leg on fire.  The
horizontal range is non-existant.  The height is determined by which
kick you use.  It is a bit safer than a dragon punch because if you
do it too soon, you might be in a defensive crouch.  If you do it too
late, you will still be blocking.  It seems to be mainly a defensive
move.

Leaping Kick: Fei Long jumps at you with a double kick.  It does
pretty decent damage.  Although he spends a lot of time moving
forward with no attack out, once the attack comes out it has one hell
of a priority.

Combos:
This combo is great against the larger characters (Zangief, Hawk)
Jumping roundhouse, short kick, Triple punch over + over

Overall:
He has the potential to be the next anti-character, like Guile was
for Ken/Ryu.  Use him against characters without projectiles for the
best chance of victory.

===================================================================
Ryu
===================================================================
Dragon Punch: --o | \  + punch
                  o  o

   Still the superior move in the game.  Deadly, but not as damaging.

Red Fireball:   o--  /  |  \  --o  +  punch
                    o   o   o
This is a red fireball that will burn the opponent like Dhalsim's
yoga fire.

Fireball:  | \  --o + punch
           o  o

He has a longer delay after his fireball and his hurricane kick now
starts spinning on the way up and all the way down, following his
jump motion.

Hurricane Kick: |  / o-- + kick
                o o
Air Hurricane Kick: Jump then HK motion

The kick still does tons of damage.  the Air HK now follows the
motion of his normal jump (arced).  The sooner you do the HK motion
during your jump, the higher you'll fly.

====================================================================
Ken
====================================================================
Changes to his DP - fierce now burns opponent and can hit 3 times.
Jab hits once and knocks down.  His hurricane kick is also like
Ryu's.  Does not have a flaming fireball..  but other than that, see
Ryu.

==============================================================================
Chun Li
==============================================================================
Fireball:   o--   --o  +  punch
         (charge)

The new fireball.
ONLY use in a situation where your opponent will definitely either be
hit (like in a combo) or will have to block (such as when an opponent
is just getting up).  The delay AFTER the fireball is even longer
than the delay in HF and the fireball (actually, it looks like a raw
egg being tossed) dissipates (dissapears) before crossing the screen.
The faster the fireball, the shorter the distance.

Helicopter Kick: | (charge) o + kick
                 o          |

The altered Helicopter kick
MUCH better against opponents jumping in, as the animation sequence
where Chun is just beginning to flip over now knocks the opponent
down (doesn't leave them standing to retaliate).  Works great vs.
Ken/Ryu, and Long.  Haven't tried it vs.  anyone else yet.  Her
aerial Helicopter (where she goes into it quickly after jumping) is
strange, but I imagine helpfull against corner traps, as it arcs in
the path of her natural jump, and goes by kinda fast.  This is one of
the more important positive changes made.

Combos:
jumping hit - standing fierce - fireball/lightning kick jumping neck
fierce - standing strong - standing fierce - lightning kick jumping
fierce - standing strong - crouching forward.

==============================================================================
Zangief
==============================================================================
Zangief's Power Moves:  360 spin from forward to down
                        and back around to front and....

    punch       -- old faithful, the SPD (spinning pile driver)
    kick        -- charge throw, or CPD (charge pile driver)
    kick (close)-- drop then flip and leap into air with them,
                       or FPD (flip pile driver)

Knee Drop:  o (hold) + fierce
            |

     No more one-hit dizzy.

Air Throws: He has TWO air throws
    fierce (and forward)--almost exactly like Z's old crouch strong throw,
       but in the air.
    roundhouse (and forward)--almost exactly like his old crouch fierce, but
       in the air--nabs them and with no pause heaves them in the air over
       his shoulder (doesn't look up like he did before)

Throws: finally got all but one normal throw checked out.
         Strong--simple pile driver from before.
         Fierce--iron claw aka far+strong from older versions
        Forward--new suplex ala fierce from older versions--heaves opponent
                 over head, then falls back, but this time he ends up
                 horizontal about 1 inch from the ground, and then you fall
down.
     Roundhouse--chin smash ala far+fierce from before
  crouch fierce--gut wrench as older versions.


==============================================================================
Blanka
==============================================================================
Blanka Ball: o--  --o + punch
          (charge)

  Still one of the fastest moves in the game.

Vertical Ball: | (charge) o + kick
               o          |

Flip Roll:  o--   --o  +  kick
        (charge)

Blanka flips back, then does a roll that has an arc to it.  If timed
right, it can go over fireballs.

He is improved in someways, DIES in others.  He now stops rolling in
his vertical roll and goes back down at an angle so he cant be swept
or dragon punched so easily.  Also, the timing of his rolls are such
that, if blocked, a quick fireball will hit it on the way down.

====================================================================
Honda
====================================================================
Thousand Hand Slap: Punch buttons over and over

   Great for corner-trapping.

Banzai Drop: | (charge) o + kick
             o          |

==============================================================================
Guile
==============================================================================
Sonic Boom:  o--  --o + punch
           (charge)

   An ever BETTER recovery than before!

Flash Kick (aka Razor Kick):  | (charge) o + kick
                              o          |

  The range for this has been dropped a bit.  More defensive now.

Mid-Air Back Breaker: --o + punch

Pretty good priority.  Watch out for mis-timing..  you need to be
almost touching to pull the move off.

====================================================================
Dhalsim
====================================================================
Dhalsim Disappear:
   --o | \  + punch  OR o-- |  / + punch
       o  o   kick          o o    kick

Either forward DRP will put you in front of your foe, either backward
will put you behind him or her.  Punch = far away, kick = near.

Fireball: | \  --o + punch
          o  o

   Just as good as Ken and Ryu's!

Yoga Flame: o-- / | \  --o
               o  o  o

   This hangs around for a LONG while!

====================================================================
Balrog
====================================================================
Buffalo Headbutt:   |   o  +  punch
                    o   |
               (charge)
   Yet another variation on the DP.

Charge Punch: o-- --o + punch = straight
               (charge) kick  = uppercut

Turn Around Punch: HOLD ALL 3 KICK then let go

This move no longer lets you go through fireballs.

Here's the bottom line:
        Power DOWN.

Against anyone w/o a fireball, Balrog will roast 'em.  Easy.
Against anyone WITH a fireball, well, you're gonna have to work.  And
hard.

Overall, he's still a power to face.... if you use him, good luck.

====================================================================
Vega
====================================================================
Air Spiral:   |  o  or o +  punch
              o   \   /
          (charge)
Vega jumps off the wall like he is going to do a claw dive, but then
dives head first across the screen in mid air.  He picks the wall
depending on where you point (up-left or up-right.)

Spread Eagle: |    o +  punch
              o    |
            (charge)

Wall Dive - Suplex: |          o  + kick, then PUNCH when near
                    o (charge) |                     your foe.

====================================================================
Sagat
====================================================================
Tiger Shots:  | \  --o + punch = high Tiger Shot
              o  o       kick  = low Tiger Shot

Tiger Uppercut: --o | \  + punch
                    o  o
                 o
Tiger Knee: / | /  + kick
           o  o

  About the only change is that his tiger knee now goes further.

====================================================================
Bison
====================================================================
Flying Dive:  |  o  +  punch
              o  |
          (charge)
He jumps really high and then comes down and hits you on the head
with his fist.

Anti-Grav Kick: |  o +  kick
                o  |
              (charge)

Still defies gravity with this jump, after it hits you can attack
again in mid-air!

Bison Torpedo :      o--    --o + punch
(aka Psycho Chrusher) (charge)

   Only hits at MOST 3 times.

  Scissor Kick: o--  --o + kick
            (charge)

   Always a knock-down move!

Principles of Constitutional Construction

Constitutional interpretation, or constitutional construction, the term more
often used by the Founders, is the process by which meanings are assigned to
words in a constitution, to enable legal decisions to be made that are justified
by it. Some scholars distinguish between "interpretation" â€” assigning meanings
based on the meanings in other usages of the terms by those the writers and
their readers had probably read, and "construction" â€” inferring the meaning from
a broader set of evidence, such as the structure of the complete document from
which one can discern the function of various parts, discussion by the drafters
or ratifiers during debate leading to adoption ("legislative history"), the
background of controversies in which the terms were used that indicate the
concerns and expectations of the drafters and ratifiers, alternative wordings
and their meanings accepted or rejected at different points in development, and
indications of meanings that can be inferred from what is not said, among other
methods of analysis.

There is also a question of whether the meanings should be taken from the public
meanings shared among the literate populace, the private meanings used among the
drafters and ratifiers that might not have been widely shared, or the public
legal meanings of terms that were best known by more advanced legal scholars of
the time. Most of the U.S. Constitution appears to have been written to be
understood by ordinary people of that era, although people then were much more
literate in the law than people are now. However, many of its words and phrases
are fairly deep legal terms that were only well understood by a few of the
legally educated Founders, even though the general population probably had a
rudimentary understanding of them.

There is a problem with the "original public meaning" formulation, because while the meanings of constitutional terms were "public" in the sense that they were not "private" or "secret", they were not necessarily familiar to ordinary people of the era. More accurate would be "legally educated and still learning public meaning", because many of the Founders themselves used terms that they had to research to find the meanings of. An example of this can be seen in the comments by Dickenson in the Federal Convention Aug. 29, 1787, about ex post facto only applying to criminal cases, after researching the topic in Blackstone's Commentaries. So since we can presume the Founders mostly agreed on the writers they considered authoritative on legal usages, we can reasonably refer to the writings of those other writers to find the meanings the Founders intended even if the Founders themselves had not yet done the research to fully master the concepts.

For constitutional terms the denotata are not empirical objects so much as ideas, that is, mental models, that do not, for the most part, have the advantage of some formal scientific models of being representable in mathematical or computer formalisms that we can examine externally. In particular, they are ideas that existed in the minds of persons long dead, so we have to develop mental models of their mental models ("theory of mind") based on the things they read and wrote. That can be done. The verification comes with being able to predict what one of them will say in a writing one hasn't read yet. Becoming adept at doing so can reassure one that one has "gotten into their heads". But that is not something one can demonstrate to others.

This leads to the admonition that the English used in the Constitution and other
legal documents of the 18th century should be read as a foreign language,
putting aside today's meanings of what seem to be the same words we use today,
and attempting to decode the meanings from various clues we can find. This is
not only wise for 18th century English, but for almost any communications, even
among people who communicate with one another daily, because no two people mean
precisely the same thing by the same words on every occasion. When both speaker
and listener are alive they are able to interrogate one another to arrive at a
common meaning, but when the author is dead we have to find evidence in other
things he or his correspondents wrote.

Constitutional controversies are about whether an official act is consistent with, and authorized by, a constitution or constitutional statute or court decision. Since a constitution is a law, and the supreme law within its domain, and authorizes statutes and other official acts which have a textual expression, the principles of constitutional interpretation are essentially the same as the principles of statutory or judicial interpretation.

Most legal scholars recognize seven main methods of judicial decisionmaking:
textual, historical, functional, doctrinal, prudential, equitable,
and natural, although they may differ on what each includes, and
there is some overlap among them.

   1. Textual. Decision based on the actual words of the written
     law, if the meaning of the words is unambiguous. Since a law is
     a command, then it must mean what it meant to the lawgiver,
     and if the meaning of the words used in it have changed since it
     was issued, then textual analysis must be of the words as
     understood by the lawgiver, which for a constitution would be
     the understanding of the ratifying convention or, if that is
     unclear, of the drafters. Some Latin maxims: A verbis legis
     non est recedendum. From the words of the law there is not
     any departure. 5 Coke 118. Noscitur ï¿½sociis. Meaning of
     words may be ascertained by associated words. 3 T.R. 87.

   2. Historical. Decision based less on the actual words than on
     the understanding revealed by analysis of the history of the
     drafting and ratification of the law, for constitutions and
     statutes, sometimes called its legislative history, and for judicial
     edicts, the case history. A textual analysis for words whose
     meanings have changed therefore overlaps historical analysis.
     It arises out of such Latin maxims as Animus hominis est
     anima scripti. Intention is the soul of an instrument. 3 Bulst.
     67.

   3. Functional. Also called structural. Decision based on
     analysis of the structures the law constituted and how they are
     apparently intended to function as a coherent, harmonious
     system. A Latin maxim is Nemo aliquam partem recte
     intelligere potest antequam totum perlegit. No one can
     properly understand a part until he has read the whole. 3 Coke
     Rep. 59.

   4. Doctrinal. Decision based on prevailing practices or opinions
     of legal professionals, mainly legislative, executive, or judicial
     precedents, according to the meta-doctrine of stare decisis,
     which treats the principles according to which court decisions
     have been made as not merely advisory but as normative.
     Some Latin maxims are: Argumentum ï¿½simili valet in lege.
     An argument from a like case avails in law. Coke, Littleton,
     191. Consuetudo et communis assuetudo ... interpretatur
     legem scriptam, si lex sit generalis. Custom and common
     usage ... interpret the written law, if it be general. Jenk. Cent.
     273. Cursus curiï¿½est lex curiï¿½ The practice of the court is
     the law of the court. 3 Buls. 53. Judiciis posterioribus fides
     est adhibenda. Credit is to be given to the latest decisions. 13
     Coke 14. Res judicata pro veritate accipitur. A thing
     adjudicated is received as true. Coke, Littleton, 103.

   5. Prudential. Decision based on factors external to the law or
     interests of the parties in the case, such as the convenience of
     overburdened officials, efficiency of governmental operations,
     avoidance of stimulating more cases, or response to political
     pressure. One such consideration, avoidance of disturbing a
     stable body of practices, is also the main motivation for the
     doctrinal method. It also includes such considerations as
     whether a case is "ripe" for decision, or whether lesser or
     administrative remedies have first been exhausted. A Latin
     maxim is Boni judicis est lites dirimere. The duty of a good
     judge is to prevent litigation. 4 Coke 15.

   6. Equitable. Also called ethical. Decision based on an innate
     sense of justice, balancing the interests of the parties, and what
     is right and wrong, regardless of what the written law might
     provide. Often resorted to in cases in which the facts were not
     adequately anticipated or provided for by the lawgivers. Some
     scholars put various balancing tests of interests and values in
     the prudential category, but it works better to distinguish
     between prudential as balancing the interests and values of
     the legal system from equitable as balancing the interests and
     values of the parties. It arises out of the Latin maxim, ï¿½uitas
     est perfecta quï¿½am ratio quï¿½jus scriptum interpretatur
     et emendat; nulla scriptura comprehensa, sed sola ratione
     consistens. Equity is a sort of perfect reason which interprets
     and amends written law; comprehended in no code, but
     consistent with reason alone. Coke, Littleton, 24.

   7. Natural. Decision based on what is required or advised by
     the laws of nature, or perhaps of human nature, and on what is
     physically or economically possible or practical, or on what is
     actually likely to occur. This has its origin in such ancient Latin
     maxims as: Jura naturï¿½sunt immutabilia. The laws of
     nature are unchangeable. Jacob. 63. Impossibilium nulla
     obligatio est. There is no obligation to do impossible things.
     D. 50, 17, 185. Lex non cogit ad impossibilia. The law does
     not compel the impossible. Hob. 96. Lex neminem cogit ad
     vana seu inutilia peragenda. The law requires no one to do
     vain or useless things. 5 Coke 21. Legibus sumptis
     desinentibus, lege naturï¿½utendum est. Laws of the state
     failing, we must act by the law of nature. 2 Rol. Rep. 98. 

Of these, only the first three, textual, historical, and functional, are methods
of interpreting or constructing the written constitution of government, and the
historical and functional methods may be more a matter of construction than
interpretation. The last, natural, is construction (not interpretation) of the
unwritten constitution of nature, or the unwritten constitution of society,
which form a hierarchy of authority, with the constitution of nature superior to
the constitution of society, and the constitution of society superior to the
written constitution of government. The doctrinal, prudential, and equitable
methods are not interpretion or construction of any of these constitutions,
although judges often claim they are. There is an misguided tendency among
modern judges to misrepresent what are essentially prudential or equitable
decisions as constitutional constructions. Too many lawyers are complicit in
this by casting what are essentially prudential or equitable arguments into
constitutional terms. There is nothing inherently wrong with making prudential
or equitable decisions. The U.S. Constitution confers both law and equity
jurisdictions on federal courts, as do the state constitutions. The problem
comes with treating such decisions as establishing precedents, especially
binding ones. It is one thing to treat a decision as a precedent that clarifies
some ambiguity in the constitution, but quite another to essentially insert a
prudential or equitable decision into the constitution as a kind of amendment.
Such decisions must not conflict with constitutions or constitutional statutes,
but often do. Doctrinal and prudential decisions are more troublesome. The
doctrinal method may be compatible with the written constitution of government
if it merely involves clarifications of ambiguities in the original text, but
not when those doctrines depart from original legal understanding, as they
sometimes do.[1] The prudential method may be justifiable as necessary to handle
large caseloads, but often neglect to render justice in particular cases,
especially when they involve avoidance of controversy rather than a desire to
settle all issues brought before the court.

Within these methods, we can, by study of the writings of the
Founders, and the writings they read, elicit such principles for
interpreting or constructing the Constitution for the United States as the following:

   1. The Constitution is the written document. Although it may
     be considered to include the understandings of its words as of
     the time of ratification, it does not include the subsequent body
     of practices or precedents upon which constitutional decisions
     might be based, which may or may not be consistent with it, or
     authorized by it. The written document refers to itself as "this
     Constitution", and provides for only four methods by which it
     may be amended, all of which apply only to the written
     document.

   2. The authority for provisions of the Constitution is the
     ratifications and state admissions. Current consent or
     acquiescence, or lack thereof, to the Constitution or any
     practice, does not affect the original constitutive acts, and has
     no authority, unless expressed through adoption of
     amendments as provided in Article V.

   3. Provisions of the Constitution are mutually consistent.
     There are no internal logical contradictions, except that a 
     provision of an amendment inconsistent with a previous 
     provision supersedes that provision.

   4. None of the words are without force and effect, except those 
     superseded by amendments, unless such amendments are repealed. 
     Except for the statement of purpose in the preamble, every word was
     intended by the Framers to be legally normative, and not just
     advisory, declaratory, aspirational, or exhortatory. Verba intelligi 
     ut aliquid operantur debent. Words should be interpreted to give 
     them some effect.

   5. Rights and powers are complementary. Every right
     recognized by the Constitution is an immunity, that is, a right
     against a positive action by government, and is equivalent to a
     restriction on delegated powers. Conversely, every delegated
     power is a restriction on immunities. An immunity may be
     expressed either as a declaration of the right, or as a restriction
     on powers.

   6. There are no redundancies within the original
     unamended Constitution. However, amendments may be
     alternative ways of expressing equivalent content in the original
     unamended Constitution or previous amendments. More
     specifically, the Bill of Rights added no new content not
     implicit in the original unamended Constitution, except the
     twenty dollar rule of the Seventh Amendment.

   7. The Constitution was intended to define a functionally
     complete and harmonious system. That does not mean,
     however, that all powers anyone might think the nation or any
     branch, level, office or department should have, were actually
     delegated.

   8. Original "intent" is functional, not motivational. The
     private motives of the Framers or Founders are irrelevant and
     largely unknowable, and likely to have been diverse. The
     common law rule of interpretation understood by the Founders
     was to discern the functional role of elements of the law, not
     the private purposes of the lawgivers.

   9. The ratification debates are the best evidence of
     original understanding. The arguments of those opposed to
     ratification are not just the positions of the losers in the
     debates, which some might dismiss as not indicative of original
     understanding. As the debates proceeded, understandings
     evolved and clarified, and positions changed. Most opponents
     were satisfied by adoption of a Bill of Rights, and by
     assurances by the proponents concerning how the words of
     the Constitution would be interpreted, and those assurances
     must be considered part of the original understanding. That
     means that a construction to which the more significant
     "anti-federalists" would object is almost certainly incorrect.

  10. Powers are narrow, rights broad. The entire theme and
     tenor of the ratification debates was that delegated powers
     were to be interpreted as strictly as possible, consistent with
     the words, and rights as broadly as possible, with the
     presumption in favor of the right, and the burden of proof on
     those claiming a power. Potestas stricte interpretatur. A
     power is strictly interpreted. In dubiis, non prï¿½umitur pro
     potentia. In cases of doubt, the presumption is not in favor of
     a power.

  11. Delegated powers cannot be subdelegated. The U.S.
     Constitution vests all legislative powers in Congress, and all
     judicial powers in the Supreme Court and inferior courts,
     except as specifically expressed. Executive branch officials
     may subdelegate but must remain responsible for the actions of
     their subordinates. There can be no authority exercised that is
     not accountable through constitutional officials.Delegata
     potestas non potest delegari. A delegated power cannot be
     delegated. 9 Inst. 597.

  12. The power to regulate is not the power to prohibit all
     modalities of something. It is only the power to issue
     prescriptions to "make regular", enforceable only by
     deprivations of property or privileges, not of life, limb, or
     liberty. There must always be some modality that is not
     prohibited.

  13. Implied powers are only to "carry into Execution" an
     expressed power and not to do whatever is necessary to
     achieve the intent for which a power might be exercised.
     Delegation of a power is delegation of the right to make a
     certain kind of effort, not to do whatever is necessary to get a
     desired outcome.

  14. There can be no common law crimes. They are in conflict
     with the prohibitions on ex post facto laws and bills of
     attainder.

  15. Rights may not be disabled or unduly burdened by
     legislative or executive process. "Due" process is judicial
     only, involving the granting of a petition to disable a right of the
     defendant, with the burden of proof on the plaintiff or
     prosecutor, and with the defendant having at least those
     minimum protections that prevailed during the Founding. with
     similar disablements having similar standards of proof and
     protection.

  16. There is no right without a remedy. Ubi jus ibi
     remedium. There must always be an accessible forum in
     which a complainant has oyer and terminer for any petition. 

  17.  The Founders were learning. "Original meaning" is not just about what the Founders consciously meant at the moment of ratification, but includes what they would discover with further study of the legal tradition they invoked in the words they chose. Thus, they referred to authors like Blackstone and Coke when they were unsure what they meant, and so must we.

  18.  Early practice indicative but not dispositive. Early practice by the Founders may provide evidence of their aspirations in the words they chose, but should not be regarded as perfect expressions of their intent. Practice can represent compromise with practical concerns and may lag behind the ideals contained in the words.

  19.Â Mental models of mental models. Each of us has a mental model of the world that includes a model of the mental models others have of the world. Communication is possible only to the extent that our mental models of the mental models of others are somehow accurate or congruent. When a lawgiver issues a law, a command to others for future compliance, he is relying on others to understand his words the way he does, and those others are relying on him to use words with the meanings they have for them. But words are an imperfect way to convey meanings, and if the recipient of the command cannot interrogate the lawgiver for his meaning, he must try to improve his mental model of the lawgiver's mental model by such means as learning to accurately predict what the lawgiver will write about matters the recipient has not previously read.

  20.Â Find the right level of abstraction. It was common for the Founders to use somewhat more concrete words to mean broader principles. Thus, "press" or "arms" is not limited to the technology of the time, but refers to the general function they served. "Militia" does not mean merely those legally obliged to respond to an official call-up, but defense activity generally.

A more complete discussion of these principles is best done by
reference to Landmark Court Decisions.

This document is a brief introduction to TCP/IP, followed by advice on
what to read for more information.  This  is  not  intended  to  be  a
complete  description.    It  can  give  you  a reasonable idea of the
capabilities of the protocols.  But if you need to know any details of
the  technology,  you  will  want  to  read  the  standards  yourself.
Throughout the text, you will find references to the standards, in the
form of "RFC" or "IEN" numbers.  These are document numbers. The final
section of this  document  tells  you  how  to  get  copies  of  those
standards.



1. What is TCP/IP?


TCP/IP  is a set of protocols developed to allow cooperating computers
to share resources across a network.  It was developed by a  community
of  researchers centered around the ARPAnet.  Certainly the ARPAnet is
the best-known TCP/IP network.  However as of June, 87, at  least  130
different  vendors  had products that support TCP/IP, and thousands of
networks of all kinds use it.

First some basic definitions.  The most accurate name for the  set  of
protocols we are describing is the "Internet protocol suite".  TCP and
IP are two of the protocols in this suite.  (They  will  be  described
below.)    Because  TCP and IP are the best known of the protocols, it
has become common to use the term TCP/IP or IP/TCP  to  refer  to  the
whole  family.  It is probably not worth fighting this habit.  However
this can lead to some oddities.  For example, I  find  myself  talking
about  NFS as being based on TCP/IP, even though it doesn't use TCP at
all.  (It does use IP.  But it  uses  an  alternative  protocol,  UDP,
instead  of TCP.  All of this alphabet soup will be unscrambled in the
following pages.)

The Internet is a  collection  of  networks,  including  the  Arpanet,
NSFnet, regional networks such as NYsernet, local networks at a number
of University and research institutions,  and  a  number  of  military
networks.  The term "Internet" applies to this entire set of networks.
The subset of them that is managed by the  Department  of  Defense  is
referred  to  as the "DDN" (Defense Data Network).  This includes some
research-oriented networks, such as  the  Arpanet,  as  well  as  more
strictly  military  ones.    (Because much of the funding for Internet
protocol developments is done via  the  DDN  organization,  the  terms
Internet  and  DDN  can  sometimes  seem  equivalent.)    All of these
networks are connected to each other.  Users can  send  messages  from
any  of  them  to  any other, except where there are security or other
policy restrictions on access.    Officially  speaking,  the  Internet
protocol  documents  are  simply  standards  adopted  by  the Internet
community for its own use.  More recently, the Department  of  Defense
issued a MILSPEC definition of TCP/IP.  This was intended to be a more
formal definition, appropriate for use in  purchasing  specifications.
However  most  of  the  TCP/IP community continues to use the Internet
standards.  The MILSPEC version is intended to be consistent with it.

Whatever it is called, TCP/IP is a family of protocols.  A few provide
                                  1
 


"low-level" functions needed for many applications.  These include IP,
TCP, and UDP.  (These will be described in a bit more  detail  later.)
Others are protocols for doing specific tasks, e.g. transferring files
between computers, sending mail, or finding out who is  logged  in  on
another   computer.      Initially  TCP/IP  was  used  mostly  between
minicomputers or mainframes.  These machines had their own disks,  and
generally  were self-contained.  Thus the most important "traditional"
TCP/IP services are:

   - file transfer.  The file transfer protocol (FTP) allows a user on
     any computer to get files from another computer, or to send files
     to another computer.  Security is handled by requiring  the  user
     to  specify  a  user  name  and  password for the other computer.
     Provisions are made for handling file transfer  between  machines
     with different character set, end of line conventions, etc.  This
     is not quite the same thing as more recent "network file  system"
     or  "netbios"  protocols, which will be described below.  Rather,
     FTP is a utility that you run any time you want to access a  file
     on  another  system.    You  use  it to copy the file to your own
     system.  You then work with the local copy.   (See  RFC  959  for
     specifications for FTP.)

   - remote  login.    The network terminal protocol (TELNET) allows a
     user to log in on any other computer on the network.  You start a
     remote session by specifying a computer to connect to.  From that
     time until you finish the session, anything you type is  sent  to
     the  other  computer.   Note that you are really still talking to
     your own computer.  But the telnet program effectively makes your
     computer invisible while it is running.  Every character you type
     is sent directly to the other system.  Generally, the  connection
     to  the  remote  computer  behaves much like a dialup connection.
     That is, the remote system will ask you to  log  in  and  give  a
     password, in whatever manner it would normally ask a user who had
     just dialed it up.  When you log off of the other  computer,  the
     telnet  program exits, and you will find yourself talking to your
     own computer.  Microcomputer implementations of telnet  generally
     include  a  terminal  emulator  for some common type of terminal.
     (See RFC's 854 and 855 for specifications for  telnet.    By  the
     way,  the  telnet protocol should not be confused with Telenet, a
     vendor of commercial network services.)

   - computer mail.  This allows you to  send  messages  to  users  on
     other  computers.    Originally, people tended to use only one or
     two specific computers.  They  would  maintain  "mail  files"  on
     those machines.  The computer mail system is simply a way for you
     to add a message to another user's mail file.    There  are  some
     problems  with  this  in  an environment where microcomputers are
     used.  The most serious is that a micro is  not  well  suited  to
     receive  computer  mail.    When you send mail, the mail software
     expects to be able  to  open  a  connection  to  the  addressee's
     computer, in order to send the mail.  If this is a microcomputer,
     it may be turned off, or it may be running an  application  other
     than  the mail system.  For this reason, mail is normally handled
     by a larger system, where it is practical to have a  mail  server
     running all the time.  Microcomputer mail software then becomes a
                                  2
 


     user interface that retrieves mail from the mail  server.    (See
     RFC  821  and  822 for specifications for computer mail.  See RFC
     937 for a protocol designed for microcomputers to use in  reading
     mail from a mail server.)

These  services  should  be  present  in any implementation of TCP/IP,
except that micro-oriented implementations may  not  support  computer
mail.  These traditional applications still play a very important role
in TCP/IP-based networks.  However more recently,  the  way  in  which
networks  are  used has been changing.  The older model of a number of
large, self-sufficient computers is beginning to  change.    Now  many
installations    have    several   kinds   of   computers,   including
microcomputers, workstations, minicomputers, and  mainframes.    These
computers  are  likely  to be configured to perform specialized tasks.
Although people are still likely to work with one  specific  computer,
that  computer  will  call on other systems on the net for specialized
services.  This has  led  to  the  "server/client"  model  of  network
services.    A server is a system that provides a specific service for
the rest of the network.  A client is another system  that  uses  that
service.    (Note  that the server and client need not be on different
computers.  They could be  different  programs  running  on  the  same
computer.)    Here  are  the  kinds  of servers typically present in a
modern computer setup.  Note that these computer services can  all  be
provided within the framework of TCP/IP.

   - network  file  systems.   This allows a system to access files on
     another computer in a somewhat more  closely  integrated  fashion
     than FTP.  A network file system provides the illusion that disks
     or other devices from one system are directly connected to  other
     systems.    There  is no need to use a special network utility to
     access a file on another system.  Your computer simply thinks  it
     has  some  extra disk drives.  These extra "virtual" drives refer
     to the other system's disks.    This  capability  is  useful  for
     several different purposes.  It lets you put large disks on a few
     computers, but still give others access to the disk space.  Aside
     from the obvious economic benefits, this allows people working on
     several computers  to  share  common  files.    It  makes  system
     maintenance  and  backup  easier, because you don't have to worry
     about updating  and  backing  up  copies  on  lots  of  different
     machines.    A  number  of  vendors  now  offer  high-performance
     diskless computers.  These computers have no disk drives at  all.
     They  are  entirely dependent upon disks attached to common "file
     servers".   (See  RFC's  1001  and  1002  for  a  description  of
     PC-oriented   NetBIOS   over   TCP.     In  the  workstation  and
     minicomputer area, Sun's Network File System is more likely to be
     used.    Protocol  specifications  for  it are available from Sun
     Microsystems.)

   - remote printing.  This allows you to  access  printers  on  other
     computers  as if they were directly attached to yours.  (The most
     commonly used protocol is the remote  lineprinter  protocol  from
     Berkeley  Unix.  Unfortunately, there is no protocol document for
     this.  However the C code is easily obtained  from  Berkeley,  so
     implementations are common.)

                                  3
 


   - remote  execution.   This allows you to request that a particular
     program be run on a different computer.  This is useful when  you
     can  do  most  of  your work on a small computer, but a few tasks
     require the resources of a larger system.  There are a number  of
     different  kinds  of remote execution.  Some operate on a command
     by command basis.  That is, you request that a  specific  command
     or  set  of commands should run on some specific computer.  (More
     sophisticated versions will choose a system that  happens  to  be
     free.)    However  there are also "remote procedure call" systems
     that allow a program to  call  a  subroutine  that  will  run  on
     another  computer.    (There  are  many  protocols  of this sort.
     Berkeley Unix contains two servers to execute commands  remotely:
     rsh  and  rexec.   The man pages describe the protocols that they
     use.  The user-contributed software with Berkeley 4.3 contains  a
     "distributed  shell"  that  will  distribute tasks among a set of
     systems, depending upon load.  Remote procedure  call  mechanisms
     have  been  a  topic  for research for a number of years, so many
     organizations have implementations of such facilities.  The  most
     widespread commercially-supported remote procedure call protocols
     seem to be Xerox's Courier and Sun's RPC.  Protocol documents are
     available  from  Xerox and Sun.  There is a public implementation
     of Courier over TCP as part of the user-contributed software with
     Berkeley  4.3.   An implementation of RPC was posted to Usenet by
     Sun, and also appears as part of  the  user-contributed  software
     with Berkeley 4.3.)

   - name  servers.    In  large  installations, there are a number of
     different collections of names that have to  be  managed.    This
     includes  users  and their passwords, names and network addresses
     for computers, and accounts.  It becomes  very  tedious  to  keep
     this data up to date on all of the computers.  Thus the databases
     are kept on a small number of systems.  Other systems access  the
     data over the network.  (RFC 822 and 823 describe the name server
     protocol used to keep track of host names and Internet  addresses
     on  the  Internet.    This  is  now a required part of any TCP/IP
     implementation.  IEN 116 describes an older name server  protocol
     that is used by a few terminal servers and other products to look
     up host names.  Sun's  Yellow  Pages  system  is  designed  as  a
     general  mechanism to handle user names, file sharing groups, and
     other databases commonly used by Unix  systems.    It  is  widely
     available  commercially.    Its  protocol definition is available
     from Sun.)

   - terminal servers.  Many installations no longer connect terminals
     directly  to  computers.    Instead they connect them to terminal
     servers.  A terminal server is simply a small computer that  only
     knows  how  to  run  telnet  (or some other protocol to do remote
     login).  If your terminal is  connected  to  one  of  these,  you
     simply  type the name of a computer, and you are connected to it.
     Generally it is possible to have active connections to more  than
     one  computer  at  the  same time.  The terminal server will have
     provisions to switch between connections rapidly, and  to  notify
     you  when  output  is  waiting for another connection.  (Terminal
     servers use the telnet protocol, already mentioned.  However  any
     real terminal server will also have to support name service and a
                                  4
 


     number of other protocols.)

   - network-oriented  window  systems.      Until   recently,   high-
     performance  graphics  programs had to execute on a computer that
     had  a  bit-mapped  graphics  screen  directly  attached  to  it.
     Network  window  systems  allow  a  program to use a display on a
     different computer.  Full-scale network window systems provide an
     interface  that  lets you distribute jobs to the systems that are
     best  suited  to  handle  them,  but  still  give  you  a  single
     graphically-based  user  interface.  (The most widely-implemented
     window system is X. A  protocol  description  is  available  from
     MIT's  Project  Athena.  A reference implementation is publically
     available from MIT.  A number  of  vendors  are  also  supporting
     NeWS,  a window system defined by Sun.  Both of these systems are
     designed to use TCP/IP.)

Note that some of the  protocols  described  above  were  designed  by
Berkeley,  Sun,  or other organizations.  Thus they are not officially
part of the Internet protocol suite.   However  they  are  implemented
using  TCP/IP, just as normal TCP/IP application protocols are.  Since
the protocol definitions are not  considered  proprietary,  and  since
commercially-support  implementations  are  widely  available,  it  is
reasonable to think of these protocols as being  effectively  part  of
the  Internet  suite.   Note that the list above is simply a sample of
the sort of services  available  through  TCP/IP.    However  it  does
contain   the  majority  of  the  "major"  applications.    The  other
commonly-used protocols tend to be specialized facilities for  getting
information  of  various  kinds, such as who is logged in, the time of
day, etc.  However if you need a facility that is not listed here,  we
encourage  you  to  look  through  the  current  edition  of  Internet
Protocols (currently RFC 1011),  which  lists  all  of  the  available
protocols,   and   also   to   look   at  some  of  the  major  TCP/IP
implementations to see what various vendors have added.



2. General description of the TCP/IP protocols


TCP/IP is a layered set of protocols.  In  order  to  understand  what
this  means,  it is useful to look at an example.  A typical situation
is sending mail.  First, there is a protocol for mail.  This defines a
set  of  commands which one machine sends to another, e.g. commands to
specify who the sender of the message is, who it is being sent to, and
then  the  text  of  the  message.  However this protocol assumes that
there is a way to communicate  reliably  between  the  two  computers.
Mail,  like  other  application  protocols,  simply  defines  a set of
commands and messages to be sent.  It is designed to be used  together
with  TCP and IP. TCP is responsible for making sure that the commands
get through to the other end.  It keeps track of  what  is  sent,  and
retransmitts anything that did not get through.  If any message is too
large for one datagram, e.g. the text of the mail, TCP will  split  it
up  into  several  datagrams,  and  make  sure  that  they  all arrive
correctly.  Since these functions are needed  for  many  applications,
they are put together into a separate protocol, rather than being part
                                  5
 


of the specifications for sending mail.   You  can  think  of  TCP  as
forming a library of routines that applications can use when they need
reliable network communications with another computer.  Similarly, TCP
calls  on the services of IP.  Although the services that TCP supplies
are needed by  many  applications,  there  are  still  some  kinds  of
applications  that  don't  need them.  However there are some services
that every application needs.  So these services are put together into
IP.    As  with TCP, you can think of IP as a library of routines that
TCP calls on, but which is also available to applications  that  don't
use  TCP.    This  strategy  of building several levels of protocol is
called "layering".  We think of  the  applications  programs  such  as
mail,  TCP, and IP, as being separate "layers", each of which calls on
the services of the layer below it.   Generally,  TCP/IP  applications
use 4 layers:

   - an application protocol such as mail

   - a  protocol  such  as  TCP  that  provides  services need by many
     applications

   - IP, which provides the basic  service  of  getting  datagrams  to
     their destination

   - the  protocols  needed to manage a specific physical medium, such
     as Ethernet or a point to point line.

TCP/IP is based on the "catenet model".  (This is  described  in  more
detail  in  IEN 48.)  This model assumes that there are a large number
of independent networks connected together  by  gateways.    The  user
should  be able to access computers or other resources on any of these
networks.   Datagrams  will  often  pass  through  a  dozen  different
networks  before  getting  to  their  final  destination.  The routing
needed to accomplish this should be completely invisible to the  user.
As  far  as  the  user  is concerned, all he needs to know in order to
access another system is an "Internet address".  This  is  an  address
that looks like 128.6.4.194.  It is actually a 32-bit number.  However
it is normally written as 4 decimal numbers, each representing 8  bits
of  the  address.  (The term "octet" is used by Internet documentation
for such 8-bit chunks.  The term "byte" is not used, because TCP/IP is
supported  by  some computers that have byte sizes other than 8 bits.)
Generally the structure of the  address  gives  you  some  information
about  how  to  get  to  the  system.  For example, 128.6 is a network
number assigned by a central authority to Rutgers University.  Rutgers
uses  the  next  octet  to  indicate  which of the campus Ethernets is
involved.  128.6.4 happens to be an  Ethernet  used  by  the  Computer
Science  Department.    The last octet allows for up to 254 systems on
each Ethernet.  (It is 254 because 0 and  255  are  not  allowed,  for
reasons  that  will  be  discussed  later.)  Note that 128.6.4.194 and
128.6.5.194 would be different systems.  The structure of an  Internet
address is described in a bit more detail later.

Of  course  we  normally  refer  to  systems  by  name, rather than by
Internet address.  When we specify a name, the network software  looks
it  up  in  a  database,  and comes up with the corresponding Internet
address.  Most of the network software deals strictly in terms of  the
                                  6
 


address.  (RFC 882 describes the name server technology used to handle
this lookup.)

TCP/IP is  built  on  "connectionless"  technology.    Information  is
transfered  as  a sequence of "datagrams".  A datagram is a collection
of data that is sent as a single message.  Each of these datagrams  is
sent  through  the network individually.  There are provisions to open
connections (i.e.  to start a conversation that will continue for some
time).    However at some level, information from those connections is
broken up into datagrams, and  those  datagrams  are  treated  by  the
network  as  completely  separate.    For example, suppose you want to
transfer a 15000 octet file.  Most networks can't handle a 15000 octet
datagram.   So the protocols will break this up into something like 30
500-octet datagrams.  Each of these datagrams  will  be  sent  to  the
other  end.    At  that point, they will be put back together into the
15000-octet file.  However while those datagrams are in  transit,  the
network doesn't know that there is any connection between them.  It is
perfectly possible  that  datagram  14  will  actually  arrive  before
datagram  13.    It is also possible that somewhere in the network, an
error will occur, and some datagram won't get through at all.  In that
case, that datagram has to be sent again.

Note  by  the way that the terms "datagram" and "packet" often seem to
be nearly interchangable.  Technically, datagram is the right word  to
use  when  describing  TCP/IP.  A datagram is a unit of data, which is
what the protocols deal with.  A packet is a physical thing, appearing
on an Ethernet or some wire.  In most cases a packet simply contains a
datagram, so there is  very  little  difference.    However  they  can
differ.  When TCP/IP is used on top of X.25, the X.25 interface breaks
the datagrams up into 128-byte packets.   This  is  invisible  to  IP,
because  the  packets  are put back together into a single datagram at
the other end before being processed by TCP/IP.  So in this case,  one
IP  datagram  would  be carried by several packets.  However with most
media, there are efficiency advantages to  sending  one  datagram  per
packet, and so the distinction tends to vanish.



2.1 The TCP level


Two separate protocols are involved in handling TCP/IP datagrams.  TCP
(the "transmission control protocol") is responsible for  breaking  up
the  message  into  datagrams,  reassembling  them  at  the other end,
resending anything that gets lost, and  putting  things  back  in  the
right  order.  IP (the "internet protocol") is responsible for routing
individual datagrams.  It may seem like TCP is  doing  all  the  work.
And  in  small networks that is true.  However in the Internet, simply
getting a datagram to its  destination  can  be  a  complex  job.    A
connection  may require the datagram to go through several networks at
Rutgers, a serial line to the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center,  a
couple  of Ethernets there, a series of 56Kbaud phone lines to another
NSFnet site, and more Ethernets on another campus.  Keeping  track  of
the  routes  to all of the destinations and handling incompatibilities
among different transport media turns out to be a complex job.    Note
                                  7
 


that  the  interface  between TCP and IP is fairly simple.  TCP simply
hands IP a datagram with a destination.   IP  doesn't  know  how  this
datagram relates to any datagram before it or after it.

It  may  have occurred to you that something is missing here.  We have
talked about Internet addresses, but not about how you keep  track  of
multiple  connections  to  a given system.  Clearly it isn't enough to
get a datagram to the right  destination.    TCP  has  to  know  which
connection  this  datagram  is  part  of.  This task is referred to as
"demultiplexing."  In fact, there are several levels of demultiplexing
going  on in TCP/IP.  The information needed to do this demultiplexing
is contained in a series of "headers".  A header is simply a few extra
octets  tacked  onto  the  beginning of a datagram by some protocol in
order to keep track of it.  It's a lot like putting a letter  into  an
envelope  and  putting  an  address  on  the  outside of the envelope.
Except with modern networks it happens several times.  It's  like  you
put the letter into a little envelope, your secretary puts that into a
somewhat bigger envelope, the campus mail center  puts  that  envelope
into a still bigger one, etc.  Here is an overview of the headers that
get stuck on a message that passes through a typical TCP/IP network:

We start with a single data stream, say a file you are trying to  send
to some other computer:

   ......................................................

TCP  breaks  it  up into manageable chunks.  (In order to do this, TCP
has to know how large a datagram your network can handle.    Actually,
the TCP's at each end say how big a datagram they can handle, and then
they pick the smallest size.)

   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....

TCP puts a header at the front of each datagram.  This header actually
contains  at least 20 octets, but the most important ones are a source
and destination "port number" and  a  "sequence  number".    The  port
numbers  are used to keep track of different conversations.  Suppose 3
different people are transferring files.  Your TCP might allocate port
numbers 1000, 1001, and 1002 to these transfers.  When you are sending
a datagram, this becomes the "source" port number, since you  are  the
source  of  the  datagram.    Of  course  the TCP at the other end has
assigned a port number of its own for the conversation.  Your TCP  has
to  know the port number used by the other end as well.  (It finds out
when the connection starts, as we will explain below.)  It  puts  this
in  the  "destination" port field.  Of course if the other end sends a
datagram back to you, the source and destination port numbers will  be
reversed,  since  then  it  will  be  the  source  and you will be the
destination.  Each datagram has a sequence number.  This  is  used  so
that  the  other  end  can make sure that it gets the datagrams in the
right  order,  and  that  it  hasn't  missed  any.    (See   the   TCP
specification for details.)  TCP doesn't number the datagrams, but the
octets.  So if there are 500 octets of  data  in  each  datagram,  the
first datagram might be numbered 0, the second 500, the next 1000, the
next 1500, etc.  Finally, I will mention the  Checksum.    This  is  a
number  that  is  computed by adding up all the octets in the datagram
                                  8
 


(more or less - see the TCP spec).  The result is put in  the  header.
TCP  at  the other end computes the checksum again.  If they disagree,
then something bad happened to the datagram in transmission, and it is
thrown away.  So here's what the datagram looks like now.

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |          Source Port          |       Destination Port        |

    |   your data ... next 500 octets                               |
    |   ......                                                      |

If  we abbreviate the TCP header as "T", the whole file now looks like
this:

   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....

You will note that there are items in  the  header  that  I  have  not
described  above.    They  are  generally  involved  with managing the
connection.  In order to make sure the datagram  has  arrived  at  its
destination,  the  recipient  has  to  send back an "acknowledgement".
This is a datagram whose "Acknowledgement number" field is filled  in.
For  example,  sending  a  packet  with  an  acknowledgement  of  1500
indicates that you have received all the data up to octet number 1500.
If  the  sender  doesn't  get  an  acknowledgement within a reasonable
amount of time, it sends the data  again.    The  window  is  used  to
control  how  much  data can be in transit at any one time.  It is not
practical to wait for each datagram to be acknowledged before  sending
the  next  one.    That would slow things down too much.  On the other
hand, you can't just keep sending, or a fast  computer  might  overrun
the  capacity  of  a slow one to absorb data.  Thus each end indicates
how much new data it is currently prepared to absorb  by  putting  the
number  of  octets  in  its  "Window" field.  As the computer receives
data, the amount of space left in its window decreases.  When it  goes
to  zero, the sender has to stop.  As the receiver processes the data,
it increases its window, indicating that it is ready  to  accept  more
data.  Often the same datagram can be used to acknowledge receipt of a
set of data and to give permission for  additional  new  data  (by  an
updated  window).  The "Urgent" field allows one end to tell the other
to skip ahead in its processing to a particular octet.  This is  often
useful  for  handling asynchronous events, for example when you type a
control character or other command that interrupts output.  The  other
fields are beyond the scope of this document.

2.2 The IP level


TCP  sends each of these datagrams to IP.  Of course it has to tell IP
the Internet address of the computer at the other end.  Note that this
is  all  IP  is concerned about.  It doesn't care about what is in the
datagram, or even in the TCP header.  IP's job is  simply  to  find  a
route for the datagram and get it to the other end.  In order to allow
gateways or other intermediate systems to  forward  the  datagram,  it
adds  its  own  header.  The main things in this header are the source
and destination Internet address (32-bit addresses, like 128.6.4.194),
the  protocol  number,  and  another  checksum.    The source Internet
address is simply the address of your machine.  (This is necessary  so
the  other  end  knows where the datagram came from.)  The destination
Internet address is the address  of  the  other  machine.    (This  is
necessary  so  any  gateways  in  the  middle  know where you want the
datagram to go.)  The protocol number tells IP at  the  other  end  to
send  the  datagram  to TCP.  Although most IP traffic uses TCP, there
are other protocols that can use IP, so you  have  to  tell  IP  which
protocol  to send the datagram to.  Finally, the checksum allows IP at
the other end to verify that the header  wasn't  damaged  in  transit.
Note  that TCP and IP have separate checksums.  IP needs to be able to
verify that the header didn't get damaged in transit, or it could send
a  message to the wrong place.  For reasons not worth discussing here,
it is both more efficient and safer to have  TCP  compute  a  separate
checksum  for  the  TCP  header  and  data.  Once IP has tacked on its
header, here's what the message looks like:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                       Source Address                          |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                    Destination Address                        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  TCP header, then your data ......                            |
    |                                                               |

If we represent the IP header by an "I",  your  file  now  looks  like
this:

   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....

Again,  the  header contains some additional fields that have not been
discussed.  Most of them are beyond the scope of this document.    The
flags  and fragment offset are used to keep track of the pieces when a
datagram has to be split up.   This  can  happen  when  datagrams  are
forwarded through a network for which they are too big.  (This will be
discussed a bit more below.)  The time to live is  a  number  that  is
decremented  whenever  the  datagram passes through a system.  When it
goes to zero, the datagram is discarded.  This is done in case a  loop
                                  10
 


develops  in the system somehow.  Of course this should be impossible,
but  well-designed  networks  are  built  to  cope  with  "impossible"
conditions.

At this point, it's possible that no more headers are needed.  If your
computer happens to have a direct phone  line  connecting  it  to  the
destination  computer,  or  to  a  gateway,  it  may  simply  send the
datagrams out on the line (though likely a synchronous  protocol  such
as  HDLC  would be used, and it would add at least a few octets at the
beginning and end).



2.3 The Ethernet level


However most of our networks these days use Ethernet.  So now we  have
to  describe  Ethernet's headers.  Unfortunately, Ethernet has its own
addresses.  The people who designed Ethernet wanted to make sure  that
no  two  machines  would  end  up  with  the  same  Ethernet  address.
Furthermore, they  didn't  want  the  user  to  have  to  worry  about
assigning  addresses.    So  each  Ethernet  controller  comes with an
address builtin from the factory.  In order to  make  sure  that  they
would  never have to reuse addresses, the Ethernet designers allocated
48 bits for the Ethernet address.  People who make Ethernet  equipment
have  to  register  with  a  central  authority, to make sure that the
numbers they assign don't overlap any other manufacturer.  Ethernet is
a "broadcast medium".  That is, it is in effect like an old party line
telephone.  When you send a packet out on the Ethernet, every  machine
on  the  network sees the packet.  So something is needed to make sure
that the right machine gets it.  As you might guess, this involves the
Ethernet  header.    Every  Ethernet packet has a 14-octet header that
includes the source and destination Ethernet address, and a type code.
Each machine is supposed to pay attention only to packets with its own
Ethernet address in the destination field.  (It's  perfectly  possible
to  cheat,  which  is  one reason that Ethernet communications are not
terribly secure.)  Note  that  there  is  no  connection  between  the
Ethernet address and the Internet address.  Each machine has to have a
table of what Ethernet address corresponds to what  Internet  address.
(We  will  describe  how  this  table is constructed a bit later.)  In
addition to the addresses, the header contains a type code.  The  type
code is to allow for several different protocol families to be used on
the same network.  So you can use TCP/IP, DECnet, Xerox  NS,  etc.  at
the  same  time.   Each of them will put a different value in the type
field.  Finally,  there  is  a  checksum.    The  Ethernet  controller
computes a checksum of the entire packet.  When the other end receives
the packet, it recomputes the checksum, and throws the packet away  if
the  answer  disagrees  with the original.  The checksum is put on the
end of the packet, not in the header.  The final result is  that  your
message looks like this:





                                  11
 


    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       Ethernet destination address (first 32 bits)            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Ethernet dest (last 16 bits)  |Ethernet source (first 16 bits)|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       Ethernet source address (last 32 bits)                  |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |        Type code              |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  IP header, then TCP header, then your data                   |
    |                                                               |
        ...
    |                                                               |
    |   end of your data                                            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                       Ethernet Checksum                       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

If  we  represent  the  Ethernet  header  with  "E",  and the Ethernet
checksum with "C", your file now looks like this:

   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C

When these packets are received by the other end, of  course  all  the
headers  are  removed.    The  Ethernet interface removes the Ethernet
header and the checksum.  It looks at the type code.  Since  the  type
code  is the one assigned to IP, the Ethernet device driver passes the
datagram up to IP.  IP removes the IP header.   It  looks  at  the  IP
protocol  field.    Since  the  protocol  type  is  TCP, it passes the
datagram up to TCP.  TCP now looks at the sequence number.    It  uses
the  sequence  numbers  and  other  information  to  combine  all  the
datagrams into the original file.

The ends our initial summary of TCP/IP.  There are still some  crucial
concepts we haven't gotten to, so we'll now go back and add details in
several areas.  (For detailed descriptions of the items discussed here
see,  RFC  793  for  TCP,  RFC  791  for IP, and RFC's 894 and 826 for
sending IP over Ethernet.)



3. Well-known sockets and the applications layer


So far, we have described how a stream  of  data  is  broken  up  into
datagrams,  sent  to another computer, and put back together.  However
something more is needed  in  order  to  accomplish  anything  useful.
There  has  to  be  a  way for you to open a connection to a specified
computer, log into it, tell it what file you  want,  and  control  the
transmission  of  the  file.   (If you have a different application in
mind, e.g. computer mail, some analogous protocol is needed.)  This is
done  by  "application  protocols".  The application protocols run "on
top" of TCP/IP.  That is, when they want to send a message, they  give
the  message  to  TCP.   TCP makes sure it gets delivered to the other
end.  Because TCP and IP take care of all the networking details,  the
                                  12
 


applications  protocols can treat a network connection as if it were a
simple byte stream, like a terminal or phone line.

Before going into more details about applications programs, we have to
describe how you find an application.  Suppose you want to send a file
to a computer whose Internet address  is  128.6.4.7.    To  start  the
process,  you  need  more than just the Internet address.  You have to
connect to the FTP server at the  other  end.    In  general,  network
programs  are  specialized  for a specific set of tasks.  Most systems
have separate programs  to  handle  file  transfers,  remote  terminal
logins, mail, etc.  When you connect to 128.6.4.7, you have to specify
that you want to talk to the FTP server.    This  is  done  by  having
"well-known  sockets"  for  each  server.    Recall that TCP uses port
numbers to keep track of  individual  conversations.    User  programs
normally  use more or less random port numbers.  However specific port
numbers are assigned to the programs that sit  waiting  for  requests.
For  example,  if  you  want  to send a file, you will start a program
called "ftp".  It will open a connection using some random number, say
1234,  for  the  port number on its end.  However it will specify port
number 21 for the other end.  This is the official port number for the
FTP server.  Note that there are two different programs involved.  You
run ftp on your side.  This is a program designed to  accept  commands
from  your  terminal  and  pass them on to the other end.  The program
that you talk to on the other machine  is  the  FTP  server.    It  is
designed  to  accept commands from the network connection, rather than
an interactive terminal.  There is no need for your program to  use  a
well-known  socket  number  for  itself.  Nobody is trying to find it.
However the servers have to have well-known numbers,  so  that  people
can  open  connections  to  them and start sending them commands.  The
official  port  numbers  for  each  program  are  given  in  "Assigned
Numbers".

Note  that  a  connection is actually described by a set of 4 numbers:
the Internet address at each end, and the TCP port number at each end.
Every  datagram  has  all  four of those numbers in it.  (The Internet
addresses are in the IP header, and the TCP port numbers  are  in  the
TCP header.)  In order to keep things straight, no two connections can
have the same set of numbers.  However it is enough for any one number
to  be  different.    For  example,  it  is perfectly possible for two
different users on a machine to be sending files  to  the  same  other
machine.    This  could  result  in  connections  with  the  following
parameters:

                   Internet addresses         TCP ports
    connection 1  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1234, 21
    connection 2  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1235, 21

Since the same machines are involved, the Internet addresses  are  the
same.    Since  they  are  both  doing  file transfers, one end of the
connection involves the well-known port number  for  FTP.    The  only
thing  that  differs is the port number for the program that the users
are running.  That's enough of a difference.  Generally, at least  one
end  of  the  connection asks the network software to assign it a port
number that is guaranteed to be unique.   Normally,  it's  the  user's
end, since the server has to use a well-known number.
                                  13
 


Now  that  we  know  how  to  open  connections, let's get back to the
applications programs.  As mentioned earlier, once TCP  has  opened  a
connection,  we  have  something  that might as well be a simple wire.
All the hard parts are handled by TCP and IP.  However we  still  need
some  agreement  as  to  what we send over this connection.  In effect
this is simply an agreement on what set of  commands  the  application
will  understand,  and  the  format  in  which  they  are  to be sent.
Generally, what is sent is a combination of commands and data.    They
use  context  to  differentiate.  For example, the mail protocol works
like this: Your mail program opens a connection to the mail server  at
the  other end.  Your program gives it your machine's name, the sender
of the message, and the recipients you want it sent to.  It then sends
a  command saying that it is starting the message.  At that point, the
other end  stops  treating  what  it  sees  as  commands,  and  starts
accepting  the  message.  Your end then starts sending the text of the
message.  At the end of the message, a special mark is sent (a dot  in
the first column).  After that, both ends understand that your program
is again sending commands.  This is the simplest way to do things, and
the one that most applications use.

File  transfer  is  somewhat more complex.  The file transfer protocol
involves two different connections.  It starts  out  just  like  mail.
The user's program sends commands like "log me in as this user", "here
is my password", "send me the file with this name".  However once  the
command  to  send  data is sent, a second connection is opened for the
data itself.  It would certainly be possible to send the data  on  the
same  connection,  as  mail does.  However file transfers often take a
long time.  The designers of the  file  transfer  protocol  wanted  to
allow  the  user  to  continue  issuing commands while the transfer is
going on.  For example, the user might make an inquiry,  or  he  might
abort  the  transfer.    Thus  the designers felt it was best to use a
separate connection for  the  data  and  leave  the  original  command
connection  for  commands.    (It  is  also  possible  to open command
connections to two different computers, and tell them to send  a  file
from  one  to  the other.  In that case, the data couldn't go over the
command connection.)

Remote terminal connections use another mechanism still.   For  remote
logins,  there  is just one connection.  It normally sends data.  When
it is necessary to send a command (e.g. to set the terminal type or to
change  some  mode),  a special character is used to indicate that the
next character is a command.  If the user happens to type that special
character as data, two of them are sent.

We  are  not  going to describe the application protocols in detail in
this document.  It's better to read the RFC's yourself.  However there
are  a  couple of common conventions used by applications that will be
described here.  First, the common network representation:  TCP/IP  is
intended  to  be  usable  on  any  computer.    Unfortunately, not all
computers agree on how data is represented.  There are differences  in
character  codes  (ASCII  vs.  EBCDIC),  in  end  of  line conventions
(carriage return, line feed, or a representation using counts), and in
whether  terminals expect characters to be sent individually or a line
at a time.   In  order  to  allow  computers  of  different  kinds  to
communicate,   each   applications   protocol   defines   a   standard
                                  14
 


representation.    Note  that  TCP  and  IP  do  not  care  about  the
representation.    TCP  simply  sends octets.  However the programs at
both ends have to agree on how the octets are to be interpreted.   The
RFC  for  each  application  specifies the standard representation for
that application.  Normally it  is  "net  ASCII".    This  uses  ASCII
characters,  with end of line denoted by a carriage return followed by
a line feed.  For remote login,  there  is  also  a  definition  of  a
"standard terminal", which turns out to be a half-duplex terminal with
echoing happening on the local machine.  Most applications  also  make
provisions  for  the  two  computers to agree on other representations
that they may find more convenient.  For example, PDP-10's have 36-bit
words.    There  is a way that two PDP-10's can agree to send a 36-bit
binary file.  Similarly, two systems that prefer full-duplex  terminal
conversations  can  agree  on  that.    However each application has a
standard representation, which every machine must support.



3.1 An example application: SMTP


In order to give a bit better idea what is involved in the application
protocols,  I'm  going  to  show an example of SMTP, which is the mail
protocol.  (SMTP is "simple mail transfer protocol.)  We assume that a
computer called TOPAZ.RUTGERS.EDU wants to send the following message.

  Date: Sat, 27 Jun 87 13:26:31 EDT
  From: hedrick@topaz.rutgers.edu
  To: levy@red.rutgers.edu
  Subject: meeting

  Let's get together Monday at 1pm.

First,  note  that the format of the message itself is described by an
Internet standard (RFC 822).  The standard specifies the fact that the
message  must be transmitted as net ASCII (i.e. it must be ASCII, with
carriage return/linefeed to delimit lines).   It  also  describes  the
general  structure, as a group of header lines, then a blank line, and
then the body of the message.  Finally, it describes the syntax of the
header  lines in detail.  Generally they consist of a keyword and then
a value.

Note  that  the  addressee  is  indicated   as   LEVY@RED.RUTGERS.EDU.
Initially,  addresses were simply "person at machine".  However recent
standards have made things more flexible.  There  are  now  provisions
for  systems  to handle other systems' mail.  This can allow automatic
forwarding on behalf of computers not connected to the Internet.    It
can be used to direct mail for a number of systems to one central mail
server.  Indeed there is no requirement that an actual computer by the
name  of RED.RUTGERS.EDU even exist.  The name servers could be set up
so that you mail to department names, and each  department's  mail  is
routed  automatically to an appropriate computer.  It is also possible
that the part before the @ is something other than a user name.  It is
possible  for  programs  to be set up to process mail.  There are also
provisions  to  handle  mailing  lists,  and  generic  names  such  as
                                  15
 


"postmaster" or "operator".

The  way  the  message is to be sent to another system is described by
RFC's 821 and 974.  The program that is going to be doing the  sending
asks  the  name server several queries to determine where to route the
message.  The first query is to find out which  machines  handle  mail
for  the  name RED.RUTGERS.EDU.  In this case, the server replies that
RED.RUTGERS.EDU handles its own mail.  The program then asks  for  the
address of RED.RUTGERS.EDU, which is 128.6.4.2.  Then the mail program
opens a TCP connection to port 25  on  128.6.4.2.    Port  25  is  the
well-known  socket  used  for receiving mail.  Once this connection is
established, the mail program starts sending  commands.    Here  is  a
typical  conversation.  Each line is labelled as to whether it is from
TOPAZ or RED.  Note that TOPAZ initiated the connection:

    RED    220 RED.RUTGERS.EDU SMTP Service at 29 Jun 87 05:17:18 EDT

First, note that commands all use normal text.  This is typical of the
Internet  standards.    Many  of  the  protocols  use  standard  ASCII
commands.  This makes it easy  to  watch  what  is  going  on  and  to
diagnose  problems.  For example, the mail program keeps a log of each
conversation.  If something goes wrong, the log  file  can  simply  be
mailed  to  the  postmaster.  Since it is normal text, he can see what
was going on.  It also allows a human to interact  directly  with  the
mail  server,  for  testing.  (Some newer protocols are complex enough
that this is not practical.  The commands would have to have a  syntax
that would require a significant parser.  Thus there is a tendency for
newer protocols to use binary formats.  Generally they are  structured
like  C or Pascal record structures.)  Second, note that the responses
all begin with numbers.  This is also typical of  Internet  protocols.
The  allowable  responses  are  defined  in the protocol.  The numbers
allow the user program to respond unambiguously.    The  rest  of  the
response  is  text,  which is normally for use by any human who may be
watching or looking at a log.  It has no effect on  the  operation  of
the  programs.  (However there is one point at which the protocol uses
part of the text of the response.)   The  commands  themselves  simply
allow  the  mail  program  on  one  end  to  tell  the mail server the
                                  16
 


information it needs to know in order to deliver the message.  In this
case,  the  mail  server  could  get the information by looking at the
message itself.  But for more complex cases, that would not  be  safe.
Every  session  must  begin  with  a HELO, which gives the name of the
system that initiated the connection.  Then the sender and  recipients
are specified.  (There can be more than one RCPT command, if there are
several recipients.)  Finally the data itself is sent.  Note that  the
text  of the message is terminated by a line containing just a period.
(If such a line appears in the message, the period is doubled.)  After
the  message  is  accepted,  the  sender  can send another message, or
terminate the session as in the example above.

Generally, there is a pattern to the response numbers.   The  protocol
defines  the  specific set of responses that can be sent as answers to
any given command.  However programs that don't want to  analyze  them
in  detail  can  just  look at the first digit.  In general, responses
that begin with a 2  indicate  success.    Those  that  begin  with  3
indicate  that some further action is needed, as shown above.  4 and 5
indicate errors.  4 is a "temporary" error, such as  a  disk  filling.
The  message should be saved, and tried again later.  5 is a permanent
error, such as a  non-existent  recipient.    The  message  should  be
returned to the sender with an error message.

(For  more  details about the protocols mentioned in this section, see
RFC's 821/822 for mail, RFC 959 for file transfer, and  RFC's  854/855
for  remote  logins.  For the well-known port numbers, see the current
edition of Assigned Numbers, and possibly RFC 814.)



4. Protocols other than TCP: UDP and ICMP


So far, we have described only connections that use TCP.  Recall  that
TCP  is  responsible  for  breaking  up  messages  into datagrams, and
reassembling them properly.  However in  many  applications,  we  have
messages  that  will  always  fit in a single datagram.  An example is
name lookup.  When a user attempts to make  a  connection  to  another
system,  he  will  generally  specify  the system by name, rather than
Internet address.  His system has to translate that name to an address
before  it  can  do  anything.  Generally, only a few systems have the
database used to translate names to addresses.  So the  user's  system
will want to send a query to one of the systems that has the database.
This query is going to be very short.  It will certainly  fit  in  one
datagram.    So  will the answer.  Thus it seems silly to use TCP.  Of
course TCP does more than just break things up  into  datagrams.    It
also  makes  sure  that  the  data  arrives, resending datagrams where
necessary.  But for a question that fits  in  a  single  datagram,  we
don't  need  all the complexity of TCP to do this.  If we don't get an
answer after a few seconds, we can just ask again.   For  applications
like this, there are alternatives to TCP.

The most common alternative is UDP ("user datagram protocol").  UDP is
designed for applications where you don't need  to  put  sequences  of
datagrams  together.  It fits into the system much like TCP.  There is
                                  17
 


a UDP header.  The network software puts the UDP header on  the  front
of  your  data, just as it would put a TCP header on the front of your
data.  Then UDP sends the data  to  IP,  which  adds  the  IP  header,
putting  UDP's  protocol number in the protocol field instead of TCP's
protocol number.  However UDP doesn't do as much  as  TCP  does.    It
doesn't  split data into multiple datagrams.  It doesn't keep track of
what it has sent so it can resend if necessary.  About  all  that  UDP
provides  is  port  numbers,  so  that several programs can use UDP at
once.  UDP port numbers are used just like TCP port  numbers.    There
are  well-known  port numbers for servers that use UDP.  Note that the
UDP header is shorter than a TCP header.   It  still  has  source  and
destination  port  numbers,  and  a checksum, but that's about it.  No
sequence number, since it is not needed.  UDP is used by the protocols
that  handle  name  lookups (see IEN 116, RFC 882, and RFC 883), and a
number of similar protocols.

Another  alternative  protocol  is  ICMP  ("Internet  control  message
protocol").    ICMP  is  used  for  error messages, and other messages
intended for the TCP/IP software itself, rather  than  any  particular
user  program.  For example, if you attempt to connect to a host, your
system may get back an ICMP message saying "host unreachable".    ICMP
can  also be used to find out some information about the network.  See
RFC 792 for details of ICMP.  ICMP is  similar  to  UDP,  in  that  it
handles messages that fit in one datagram.  However it is even simpler
than UDP.  It doesn't even have port numbers in its header.  Since all
ICMP  messages are interpreted by the network software itself, no port
numbers are needed to say where a ICMP message is supposed to go.



5. Keeping track of names and information: the domain system


As we indicated earlier, the network software generally needs a 32-bit
Internet  address  in  order  to open a connection or send a datagram.
However users prefer to deal with computer names rather than  numbers.
Thus  there  is  a database that allows the software to look up a name
and find the corresponding number.  When the Internet was small,  this
was  easy.  Each system would have a file that listed all of the other
systems, giving both their name and number.  There are  now  too  many
computers  for  this  approach to be practical.  Thus these files have
been replaced by a set of name servers that keep track of  host  names
and  the corresponding Internet addresses.  (In fact these servers are
somewhat more general than that.  This is just one kind of information
stored in the domain system.)  Note that a set of interlocking servers
are used, rather than a single central one.  There  are  now  so  many
different  institutions  connected  to  the  Internet that it would be
impractical for them to  notify  a  central  authority  whenever  they
installed  or moved a computer.  Thus naming authority is delegated to
individual institutions.  The name servers form a tree,  corresponding
to  institutional  structure.    The names themselves follow a similar
structure.  A typical example is the name BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  This  is
a  computer  at  the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) at MIT.  In
order to find its Internet address,  you  might  potentially  have  to
consult  4  different  servers.  First, you would ask a central server
                                  18
 


(called the root) where the EDU server is.  EDU is a server that keeps
track of educational institutions.  The root server would give you the
names and Internet addresses of several servers for EDU.   (There  are
several  servers  at  each  level,  to allow for the possibly that one
might be down.)  You would then ask EDU where the server for  MIT  is.
Again,  it  would  give  you  names  and Internet addresses of several
servers for MIT.  Generally, not all of those servers would be at MIT,
to  allow for the possibility of a general power failure at MIT.  Then
you would ask MIT where the server for LCS is, and finally  you  would
ask one of the LCS servers about BORAX.  The final result would be the
Internet address for BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.    Each  of  these  levels  is
referred  to  as  a  "domain".  The entire name, BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU, is
called a "domain name".    (So  are  the  names  of  the  higher-level
domains, such as LCS.MIT.EDU, MIT.EDU, and EDU.)

Fortunately,  you  don't really have to go through all of this most of
the time.  First of all, the root name servers also happen to  be  the
name  servers  for  the  top-level domains such as EDU.  Thus a single
query to a root  server  will  get  you  to  MIT.    Second,  software
generally  remembers answers that it got before.  So once we look up a
name at LCS.MIT.EDU, our software remembers where to find servers  for
LCS.MIT.EDU,  MIT.EDU,  and EDU.  It also remembers the translation of
BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Each of these pieces of information has a "time to
live"  associated with it.  Typically this is a few days.  After that,
the information expires and has to be looked up again.    This  allows
institutions to change things.

The  domain  system  is not limited to finding out Internet addresses.
Each domain name is a node in a database.  The node can  have  records
that  define  a number of different properties.  Examples are Internet
address, computer type, and a list of services provided by a computer.
A  program  can  ask  for  a  specific  piece  of  information, or all
information about a given name.  It is possible  for  a  node  in  the
database  to  be  marked as an "alias" (or nickname) for another node.
It is also possible to use the  domain  system  to  store  information
about users, mailing lists, or other objects.

There  is  an  Internet  standard  defining  the  operation  of  these
databases, as well as the protocols used  to  make  queries  of  them.
Every  network utility has to be able to make such queries, since this
is now the official way to evaluate host names.   Generally  utilities
will talk to a server on their own system.  This server will take care
of contacting the other servers for them.  This keeps down the  amount
of code that has to be in each application program.

The  domain  system  is  particularly  important for handling computer
mail.  There are entry types to define what computer handles mail  for
a  given  name, to specify where an individual is to receive mail, and
to define mailing lists.

(See RFC's 882, 883, and 973 for specifications of the domain  system.
RFC 974 defines the use of the domain system in sending mail.)

6. Routing


The   description  above  indicated  that  the  IP  implementation  is
responsible for getting datagrams to the destination indicated by  the
destination address, but little was said about how this would be done.
The task of finding how to  get  a  datagram  to  its  destination  is
referred to as "routing".  In fact many of the details depend upon the
particular implementation.  However some general things can be said.

First, it is necessary to understand the model on which IP  is  based.
IP assumes that a system is attached to some local network.  We assume
that the system can send datagrams to any  other  system  on  its  own
network.    (In  the  case  of  Ethernet, it simply finds the Ethernet
address of the destination system, and puts the datagram  out  on  the
Ethernet.)    The  problem  comes  when  a  system  is asked to send a
datagram to a system on a different network.  This problem is  handled
by  gateways.   A gateway is a system that connects a network with one
or more other networks.  Gateways  are  often  normal  computers  that
happen  to have more than one network interface.  For example, we have
a Unix machine that has two different Ethernet interfaces.  Thus it is
connected  to networks 128.6.4 and 128.6.3.  This machine can act as a
gateway between those two networks.  The software on that machine must
be  set  up  so that it will forward datagrams from one network to the
other.  That is, if a machine on network 128.6.4 sends a  datagram  to
the  gateway,  and  the  datagram is addressed to a machine on network
128.6.3, the gateway will forward the  datagram  to  the  destination.
Major communications centers often have gateways that connect a number
of different  networks.    (In  many  cases,  special-purpose  gateway
systems provide better performance or reliability than general-purpose
systems acting as gateways.  A number of vendors sell such systems.)

Routing in IP is  based  entirely  upon  the  network  number  of  the
destination  address.    Each computer has a table of network numbers.
For each network number, a gateway is listed.  This is the gateway  to
be used to get to that network.  Note that the gateway doesn't have to
connect directly to the network.  It just has to be the best place  to
go  to  get there.  For example at Rutgers, our interface to NSFnet is
at the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center (JvNC). Our connection  to
JvNC  is  via  a  high-speed  serial line connected to a gateway whose
address is 128.6.3.12.  Systems on net 128.6.3 will list 128.6.3.12 as
the  gateway  for  many  off-campus  networks.  However systems on net
128.6.4 will list 128.6.4.1 as the gateway to  those  same  off-campus
networks.    128.6.4.1  is  the  gateway  between networks 128.6.4 and
128.6.3, so it is the first step in getting to JvNC.

When a computer wants to send a datagram, it first checks  to  see  if
the  destination address is on the system's own local network.  If so,
the datagram can be sent directly.  Otherwise, the system  expects  to
find an entry for the network that the destination address is on.  The
datagram is sent to the gateway listed in that entry.  This table  can
get quite big.  For example, the Internet now includes several hundred
individual networks.  Thus various strategies have been  developed  to
reduce  the size of the routing table.  One strategy is to depend upon
"default routes".  Often, there is only one gateway out of a  network.
                                  20
 


This  gateway might connect a local Ethernet to a campus-wide backbone
network.  In that case, we don't need to have  a  separate  entry  for
every  network  in  the  world.    We  simply define that gateway as a
"default".  When no specific  route  is  found  for  a  datagram,  the
datagram  is  sent to the default gateway.  A default gateway can even
be used when there are several gateways  on  a  network.    There  are
provisions  for  gateways  to  send a message saying "I'm not the best
gateway -- use this one instead."  (The message is sent via ICMP.  See
RFC  792.)  Most network software is designed to use these messages to
add entries to their routing tables.  Suppose network 128.6.4 has  two
gateways, 128.6.4.59 and 128.6.4.1.  128.6.4.59 leads to several other
internal Rutgers networks.  128.6.4.1 leads indirectly to the  NSFnet.
Suppose  we  set  128.6.4.59  as  a default gateway, and have no other
routing table entries.  Now what  happens  when  we  need  to  send  a
datagram  to  MIT?    MIT  is  network 18.  Since we have no entry for
network 18, the datagram will be sent to the default, 128.6.4.59.   As
it  happens,  this  gateway  is the wrong one.  So it will forward the
datagram to 128.6.4.1.  But it will also send back an error saying  in
effect: "to get to network 18, use 128.6.4.1".  Our software will then
add an entry to the routing table.  Any future datagrams to  MIT  will
then  go  directly to 128.6.4.1.  (The error message is sent using the
ICMP protocol.  The message type is called "ICMP redirect.")

Most IP experts recommend that individual computers should not try  to
keep  track  of  the  entire network.  Instead, they should start with
default gateways, and let the gateways tell them the routes,  as  just
described.   However this doesn't say how the gateways should find out
about the routes.  The gateways can't depend upon this strategy.  They
have  to  have fairly complete routing tables.  For this, some sort of
routing protocol is needed.  A routing protocol is simply a  technique
for  the  gateways  to  find each other, and keep up to date about the
best way to get to every network.   RFC  1009  contains  a  review  of
gateway  design  and  routing.    However rip.doc is probably a better
introduction to the subject.  It contains some tutorial material,  and
a detailed description of the most commonly-used routing protocol.



7. Details about Internet addresses: subnets and broadcasting


As  indicated earlier, Internet addresses are 32-bit numbers, normally
written as 4 octets (in decimal), e.g. 128.6.4.7.  There are  actually
3  different types of address.  The problem is that the address has to
indicate both the network and the host within the  network.    It  was
felt  that  eventually  there would be lots of networks.  Many of them
would be small, but probably 24 bits would be needed to represent  all
the  IP  networks.  It was also felt that some very big networks might
need 24 bits to represent all of their hosts.  This would seem to lead
to  48  bit  addresses.  But the designers really wanted to use 32 bit
addresses.  So they adopted a kludge.  The assumption is that most  of
the  networks will be small.  So they set up three different ranges of
address.  Addresses beginning with 1 to 126 use only the  first  octet
for  the network number.  The other three octets are available for the
host number.  Thus 24 bits are available for hosts.  These numbers are
                                  21
 


used  for large networks.  But there can only be 126 of these very big
networks.  The Arpanet is one, and there are a  few  large  commercial
networks.    But  few  normal organizations get one of these "class A"
addresses.  For normal large organizations, "class  B"  addresses  are
used.    Class  B  addresses  use the first two octets for the network
number.  Thus network numbers are 128.1 through 191.254.  (We avoid  0
and  255,  for  reasons  that  we  see below.  We also avoid addresses
beginning with 127, because that is used by some systems  for  special
purposes.)    The  last  two  octets  are available for host addesses,
giving 16 bits of host address.   This  allows  for  64516  computers,
which should be enough for most organizations.  (It is possible to get
more than one class B address, if you run  out.)    Finally,  class  C
addresses  use  three  octets,  in  the  range 192.1.1 to 223.254.254.
These allow only 254 hosts on each network, but there can be  lots  of
these  networks.   Addresses above 223 are reserved for future use, as
class D and E (which are currently not defined).

Many large organizations find it convenient to  divide  their  network
number into "subnets".  For example, Rutgers has been assigned a class
B address, 128.6.  We find it convenient to use the third octet of the
address to indicate which Ethernet a host is on.  This division has no
significance outside of Rutgers.  A computer  at  another  institution
would treat all datagrams addressed to 128.6 the same way.  They would
not look at the third octet of the address.   Thus  computers  outside
Rutgers  would  not have different routes for 128.6.4 or 128.6.5.  But
inside Rutgers, we treat 128.6.4 and 128.6.5 as separate networks.  In
effect, gateways inside Rutgers have separate entries for each Rutgers
subnet, whereas gateways outside  Rutgers  just  have  one  entry  for
128.6.  Note  that  we  could  do  exactly  the  same thing by using a
separate class C address for each Ethernet.   As  far  as  Rutgers  is
concerned,  it  would be just as convenient for us to have a number of
class C addresses.  However using class C addresses would make  things
inconvenient for the rest of the world.  Every institution that wanted
to talk to us would have to have a separate entry for each one of  our
networks.   If every institution did this, there would be far too many
networks for any reasonable gateway to keep track of.  By  subdividing
a  class B network, we hide our internal structure from everyone else,
and  save  them  trouble.    This  subnet  strategy  requires  special
provisions in the network software.  It is described in RFC 950.

0  and  255  have  special  meanings.  0 is reserved for machines that
don't know their address.  In certain circumstances it is possible for
a  machine not to know the number of the network it is on, or even its
own host address.  For example, 0.0.0.23 would be a machine that  knew
it was host number 23, but didn't know on what network.

255  is  used for "broadcast".  A broadcast is a message that you want
every system on the network to see.    Broadcasts  are  used  in  some
situations  where you don't know who to talk to.  For example, suppose
you need to look  up  a  host  name  and  get  its  Internet  address.
Sometimes  you  don't know the address of the nearest name server.  In
that case, you might send the request as a broadcast.  There are  also
cases  where a number of systems are interested in information.  It is
then less expensive to send a single broadcast than to send  datagrams
individually  to  each host that is interested in the information.  In
                                  22
 


order to send a broadcast, you use an address that is  made  by  using
your  network  address, with all ones in the part of the address where
the host number goes.  For example, if you are on network 128.6.4, you
would   use   128.6.4.255  for  broadcasts.    How  this  is  actually
implemented depends upon the medium.   It  is  not  possible  to  send
broadcasts  on the Arpanet, or on point to point lines.  However it is
possible on an Ethernet.  If you use an Ethernet address with all  its
bits  on (all ones), every machine on the Ethernet is supposed to look
at that datagram.

Although the official broadcast address for  network  128.6.4  is  now
128.6.4.255,  there  are  some  other addresses that may be treated as
broadcasts by certain implementations.  For convenience, the  standard
also  allows  255.255.255.255 to be used.  This refers to all hosts on
the local network.  It is often simpler to use 255.255.255.255 instead
of  finding out the network number for the local network and forming a
broadcast address such as 128.6.4.255.   In  addition,  certain  older
implementations  may  use  0  instead  of  255  to  form the broadcast
address.    Such  implementations  would  use  128.6.4.0  instead   of
128.6.4.255  as  the  broadcast  address on network 128.6.4.  Finally,
certain older implementations may not understand about subnets.   Thus
they consider the network number to be 128.6.  In that case, they will
assume a broadcast address  of  128.6.255.255  or  128.6.0.0.    Until
support  for  broadcasts is implemented properly, it can be a somewhat
dangerous feature to use.

Because 0 and 255 are used for unknown and broadcast addresses, normal
hosts  should never be given addresses containing 0 or 255.  Addresses
should never begin with 0, 127, or any number above  223.    Addresses
violating these rules are sometimes referred to as "Martians", because
of rumors that the Central University of Mars is using network 225.



8. Datagram fragmentation and reassembly


TCP/IP is designed for use  with  many  different  kinds  of  network.
Unfortunately,  network  designers  do not agree about how big packets
can be.  Ethernet packets can be 1500 octets long.    Arpanet  packets
have  a  maximum  of around 1000 octets.  Some very fast networks have
much larger packet sizes.  At first, you might think  that  IP  should
simply  settle  on  the  smallest  possible size.  Unfortunately, this
would cause serious performance problems.    When  transferring  large
files, big packets are far more efficient than small ones.  So we want
to be able to use the largest packet size possible.  But we also  want
to  be  able  to  handle  networks  with  small limits.  There are two
provisions for this.  First, TCP has the ability to "negotiate"  about
datagram  size.  When a TCP connection first opens, both ends can send
the maximum datagram size they can  handle.    The  smaller  of  these
numbers  is  used  for  the  rest  of the connection.  This allows two
implementations that can handle big datagrams to use  them,  but  also
lets  them  talk  to  implementations that can't handle them.  However
this doesn't completely solve the problem.  The most  serious  problem
is  that the two ends don't necessarily know about all of the steps in
                                  23
 


between.  For example, when sending data between Rutgers and Berkeley,
it is likely that both computers will be on Ethernets.  Thus they will
both  be  prepared  to  handle  1500-octet  datagrams.    However  the
connection will at some point end up going over the Arpanet.  It can't
handle packets of that size.  For this reason, there are provisions to
split   datagrams   up   into   pieces.    (This  is  referred  to  as
"fragmentation".)  The IP header  contains  fields  indicating  the  a
datagram  has  been split, and enough information to let the pieces be
put back together.  If a gateway connects an Ethernet to the  Arpanet,
it must be prepared to take 1500-octet Ethernet packets and split them
into pieces that will fit on the Arpanet.    Furthermore,  every  host
implementation  of  TCP/IP  must  be prepared to accept pieces and put
them back together.  This is referred to as "reassembly".

TCP/IP implementations differ in the approach they take to deciding on
datagram  size.    It  is  fairly  common  for  implementations to use
576-byte datagrams whenever they can't verify that the entire path  is
able  to  handle larger packets.  This rather conservative strategy is
used because of the number of implementations with bugs in the code to
reassemble  fragments.    Implementors  often try to avoid ever having
fragmentation occur.  Different implementors take different approaches
to  deciding  when  it  is safe to use large datagrams.  Some use them
only for the local network.  Others will use them for any  network  on
the   same   campus.    576  bytes  is  a  "safe"  size,  which  every
implementation must support.



9. Ethernet encapsulation: ARP


There was a brief discussion earlier about what IP datagrams look like
on  an  Ethernet.    The  discussion  showed  the  Ethernet header and
checksum.  However it left one hole: It didn't say how to  figure  out
what Ethernet address to use when you want to talk to a given Internet
address.  In fact, there is a separate protocol for this,  called  ARP
("address  resolution protocol").  (Note by the way that ARP is not an
IP protocol.  That is, the ARP datagrams  do  not  have  IP  headers.)
Suppose  you  are  on  system  128.6.4.194  and you want to connect to
system 128.6.4.7.  Your system will first verify that 128.6.4.7 is  on
the  same network, so it can talk directly via Ethernet.  Then it will
look up 128.6.4.7 in its ARP table, to see if  it  already  knows  the
Ethernet  address.    If  so, it will stick on an Ethernet header, and
send the packet.  But suppose this system is not  in  the  ARP  table.
There  is  no  way  to  send the packet, because you need the Ethernet
address.  So it  uses  the  ARP  protocol  to  send  an  ARP  request.
Essentially  an  ARP  request  says  "I  need the Ethernet address for
128.6.4.7".  Every system listens to ARP requests.  When a system sees
an  ARP  request  for itself, it is required to respond.  So 128.6.4.7
will see the request, and will respond with an  ARP  reply  saying  in
effect "128.6.4.7 is 8:0:20:1:56:34".  (Recall that Ethernet addresses
are 48 bits.  This is 6 octets.  Ethernet addresses are conventionally
shown  in  hex,  using  the punctuation shown.)  Your system will save
this information in its ARP table, so future packets will go directly.
Most  systems  treat the ARP table as a cache, and clear entries in it
                                  24
 


if they have not been used in a certain period of time.

Note by the way that ARP requests must be sent as "broadcasts".  There
is  no  way  that  an  ARP  request  can be sent directly to the right
system.  After all, the whole reason for sending  an  ARP  request  is
that  you  don't know the Ethernet address.  So an Ethernet address of
all ones is  used,  i.e.  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.    By  convention,  every
machine  on  the Ethernet is required to pay attention to packets with
this as an address.  So every system sees every ARP  requests.    They
all  look to see whether the request is for their own address.  If so,
they respond.  If not, they could just ignore it.   (Some  hosts  will
use  ARP  requests  to update their knowledge about other hosts on the
network, even if the request isn't for them.)  Note that packets whose
IP  address  indicates broadcast (e.g. 255.255.255.255 or 128.6.4.255)
are also sent with an Ethernet address that is all ones.



10. Getting more information


This directory contains  documents  describing  the  major  protocols.
There  are literally hundreds of documents, so we have chosen the ones
that seem most important.  Internet standards are called RFC's.    RFC
stands  for  Request  for  Comment.   A proposed standard is initially
issued as a proposal, and given an RFC number.   When  it  is  finally
accepted,  it is added to Official Internet Protocols, but it is still
referred to by the RFC number.   We  have  also  included  two  IEN's.
(IEN's  used  to  be  a  separate  classification  for  more  informal
documents.  This classification no longer exists -- RFC's are now used
for  all  official  Internet documents, and a mailing list is used for
more informal reports.)  The convention is that  whenever  an  RFC  is
revised, the revised version gets a new number.  This is fine for most
purposes, but it causes problems with two documents: Assigned  Numbers
and  Official  Internet  Protocols.  These documents are being revised
all the time, so the RFC number keeps changing.  You will have to look
in rfc-index.txt to find the number of the latest edition.  Anyone who
is seriously interested in TCP/IP should read the  RFC  describing  IP
(791).    RFC 1009 is also useful.  It is a specification for gateways
to be used by NSFnet.  As such, it contains an overview of  a  lot  of
the  TCP/IP technology.  You should probably also read the description
of at least one of the application protocols, just to get a  feel  for
the  way  things  work.    Mail is probably a good one (821/822).  TCP
(793) is of course a very basic specification.  However  the  spec  is
fairly  complex,  so  you should only read this when you have the time
and patience to think about it carefully.  Fortunately, the author  of
the  major  RFC's  (Jon Postel) is a very good writer.  The TCP RFC is
far easier to read than you would expect, given the complexity of what
it  is  describing.    You  can  look at the other RFC's as you become
curious about their subject matter.

Here is a list of the documents you are more likely to want:

     rfc-index list of all RFC's

                                  25
 


     rfc1065/6/7
               Simple  Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  A protocol
               to get information from gateways and hosts, to  monitor
               failures,   and   to  reconfigure  gateways  and  hosts
               remotely.  This protocol will  be  the  foundation  for
               network  management  activities  involving TCP/IP.  RFC
               1028 documents the Simple Gateway  Monitoring  Protocol
               (SGMP),  which  is an interim protocol on which SNMP is
               based.  SGMP will be replaced by SNMP during 1988/89.

     rfc1064,1056,937
               protocols for reading mail on PC's

     rfc1062   Assigned  Numbers.  If you are working with TCP/IP, you
               will probably want a hardcopy of this as  a  reference.
               It's  not  very exciting to read, but is essential.  It
               lists all the offically defined  well-known  ports  and
               lots of other things.

     rfc1059   Network  Time  Protocol.   A protocol for synchronizing
               the time on all your machines.  Also allows you to  get
               time from one of the national time standards.

     rfc1058   Routing  Information  Protocol.    Details  of the most
               commonly-used routing protocol.

     rfc1057   RPC.  A protocol for remote  procedure  calls.    Sun's
               Network  File  System is based on this.  The actual NFS
               protocol specification is currently available only from
               Sun.    Sun  supplies a public domain implementation of
               RPC.  Aside from its use by NFS  (whose  implementation
               is not public domain), RPC has been used by a number of
               groups  for  building  server/client  systems  such  as
               remote database servers.  See also RFC 1014.

     rfc1042   IP  encapsulation  for IEEE 802 networks.  This will be
               used for the IEEE  token  ring,  broadband,  etc.    In
               principle  it  seems  that  this  would cover Ethernet,
               since  Ethernet  is  IEEE  802.3.  However  the  normal
               encapsulation used on Ethernet is defined by RFC 894.

     rfc1032/3/4/5
               domains (the database used to go  from  host  names  to
               Internet  address  and back -- also used to handle UUCP
               these days).  This includes protocol standards, as well
               as information directed at people who are going to have
               to set up a domain name server.  Every site should have
               a copy of these documents.

     rfc1014   XDR:  External  Data  Representation Standard.  This is
               part of the specifications for Sun's RPC protocol  (RFC
               1057),  which  is the protocol underlying Sun's Network
               File System.

     rfc1013   X Window System Protocol, Version 11.    Documents  the
                                  26
 


               most commonly used remote window system.

     rfc1012   list  of  all  RFC's  below  1000,  with  somewhat more
               information than rfc-index.

     rfc1011   Official Protocols.  It's useful to scan  this  to  see
               what tasks protocols have been built for.  This defines
               which  RFC's  are  actual  standards,  as  opposed   to
               requests for comments.

     rfc1009   NSFnet  gateway  specifications.  A good overview of IP
               routing and gateway technology.

     rfc1001/2 netBIOS: networking for PC's

     rfc959    FTP (file transfer)

     rfc950    subnets

     rfc894    how IP is to be put on Ethernet, see also rfc825

     rfc854/5  telnet - protocol for remote logins

     rfc826    ARP - protocol for finding out Ethernet addresses

     rfc821/2  mail

     rfc814    names and ports - general  concepts  behind  well-known
               ports

     rfc793    TCP

     rfc792    ICMP

     rfc791    IP

     rfc768    UDP

     ien-116   old  name  server  (still  needed  by  several kinds of
               system)

     ien-48    the  Catenet  model,   general   description   of   the
               philosophy behind TCP/IP

The following documents are somewhat more specialized.

     rfc1055   SLIP (IP for dialup lines)

     rfc1054   IP multicasting

     rfc1048   Bootp,  a protocol often used to allow diskless systems
               to find their IP address.

     rfc813    window and acknowledgement strategies in TCP

                                  27
 


     rfc815    datagram reassembly techniques

     rfc816    fault isolation and resolution techniques

     rfc817    modularity and efficiency in implementation

     rfc879    the maximum segment size option in TCP

     rfc896    congestion control

     rfc827,888,904,975,985
               EGP and related issues

To  those  of you who may be reading this document remotely instead of
at Rutgers: The most  important  RFC's  have  been  collected  into  a
three-volume set, the DDN Protocol Handbook.  It is available from the
DDN Network Information  Center,  SRI  International,  333  Ravenswood
Avenue,  Menlo  Park, California 94025 (telephone: 800-235-3155).  You
should be able to get them via anonymous FTP from sri-nic.arpa.   File
names are:

  RFC's:
    rfc:rfc-index.txt
    rfc:rfcxxx.txt
  IEN's:
    ien:ien-index.txt
    ien:ien-xxx.txt

Sites with access to UUCP but not FTP may be able to retreive them via
UUCP from UUCP host rutgers.  The file names would be

  RFC's:
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/rfc-index.txt
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/rfcxxx.txt
  IEN's:
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/ien-index.txt
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/ien-xxx.txt

Note that SRI-NIC has the entire set of RFC's and IEN's,  but  rutgers
and topaz have only those specifically mentioned above.

** LETTER D70 ***

Hello again fellow GMJ readers.  Lots going on right now here at GMJ.
The first Electronic Print issue is finally out and we have been
overwhelmed by the response.  For those of you who just can't afford
the lengthy download, we have an extremely low price for a
subscription offer.  Check out an ad this issue for all of the
details.

The main theme the last few weeks has to be the 3DO.  Panasonic
released the $700 monster early November and it is taking off pretty
well.  We had a chance to test this money vacuum out recently and we
were pretty impressed.  Check out the Power Switch section this issue
to get all of the hands on test details for the 3DO from the Game
Masters.

You Genesis players will be happy to hear that Mortal Kombat is the
number one selling 16 bit title right now even topping the SNES
version in sales for last month.  Why? I really don't know.  The SNES
version is a much better translation.  I guess this just proves that
MK's blood and gore is what makes it.

You are really going to start to see expanded coverage starting this
issue.  We are still playing around with the formats both Ansi and
Electronic Print.  You probably noticed fact windows in our review
section in issue #32 with a few new pieces of information like megs,
who reviewed the game and average of reviews.  Adding to that, is our
hyper text capsules which will be featured next to random reviews.
These capsules will have game PREviews and tidbits of info.

Don't expect to see GMJ every week anymore, we are changing to
bi-weekly.  The reason is that we can put out a much higher quality
issue in 2 weeks and we have reached a point where it is no longer
necessary to come out weekly.  The Elec- tronic print version will
stay monthly and will come out 12+ times per year.

Those of you reading the Electronic Print version enjoyed some Super
SFII art on our cover done by my sister...I'm sorry.  I really am.  I
didn't want to do it, but Street Fighter is Street Fighter and I had
to do it.  I promise there won't be eight SFII covers with in the next
12 issues! While we are on the subject however, check out some
exclusive Super Street Fighter coverage this issue: All the moves for
every character! (and we even avoided listing those phunky character
profiles.  You know, the ones that tell you how many hours of sleep
Ryu gets before his hard training at the Dojo.)

Hey everybody, before I let you read on, let me remind you to not buy
any new systems until sometime in '95 when Nintendo will release their
recently announced 64 Bit system (which by the way GMJ reported before
ANYONE else) for under $250.....yeah right! Ok, so even if it is so
great, and it is that inexpensive, why am I going to wait until 1995?
Listen, if you are always waiting for the next best thing, you will
never own anything.  I like Sega's approach.  Give us a system when
it's ready, let us enjoy it, and release a new system when it's time.
If I had listened to Nintendo last year trying to convince me not to
buy a Sega CD because their more advanced CD would be here in early
'93 and for less, I would be pretty pissed off right now.

Well, that is it for now.  Enjoy our expanded coverage and additional
sections.

      -  Reny Falzarano  [Da Phunky Pheel One]

Just like Mortal Kombat (but with less hype), Konami's Zombies Ate My
Neighbors was released for the S-NES and Genesis on the same day, so
we here at GMJ decided to run a comparison explaining the differences
in each of the versions.  So sit back and relax, 'cause this is one
wild ride.

Both the S-Nes and Genesis versions share the same story-line; to stop
the hordes of evil from capturing your local towns occupants.  You can
choose to rush into action as either a guy that looks like a follower
of Beavis and Butthead, or a pony tail wielding woman that might be
the twin of Mindy from the tv show "Mork and Mindy".  A two player
cooperative option is available so that you're not alone in this never
ending fight to save your town.

Zombies uses a "tongue in cheek" approach to killing the baddies,
because the weapons you use include a water gun, weed whacker, fire
extinguisher, apples, and other household goodies.  You fight in over
forty levels of never ending mayhem, with some levels including a
local mall, a school, and a maze of hedges.  The enemies in this game
are too numerous to count because they all change according to the
level your playing on.  This unique approach makes the game original,
but there is no attention given to the progress of any story.  The
only real goal is to "tag" the residents of the level before a bad guy
kills them.  The residents are spread out all around the levels, and
each level ends when all the people have either been saved or killed.


S-NES version - 83

The S-NES version and Genesis versions of Zombie both sport the same
levels and the same graphics, but the S-NES uses music and sound a
whole lot more effectively, and the control is be better on this one
as well because of the more buttons used.  The title screen is the
first sign that really shows the differences; the S-Nes version has
the Zombies logo gradually morph into view, where the Genesis version
has very little morphing.  The opening music and voices are also done
better on the S-NES version.

The play mechanics and control are a lot better on the S-NES version
because it's full screen, while the Sega version has a two inch black
bar running along the entire right side of the screen.  Just being
able to see more of the screen adds to the S-NES Zombies, because you
have more time to react to the oncoming enemies.  The graphics are
also larger than those for the Sega version and playing them both
right after each other really shows which is superior.

Not only is the screen size a difference in the two Zombies, but the
music, when compared to each other, is a total blowout with the
S-NES's better sound capabilities destroying the Sega version.  Hooked
up to a stereo system, the Zombies soundtrack booms with some house
shaking bass and some of the better video game sounds on the market
being used.  Real samples of screams and explosions were used to give
a sense of realism to Zombies, while the rest of the game comes off as
a B-movie style game with many cliches being used.

Genesis version - 70

The Sega version of Zombies and I got off to a bad start; I played
Zombies on my S-NES and expected an almost identical version on the
Sega.  I was wrong.  The programmers took a shotty approach in the
making of the Sega version, and I was honestly disappointed with the
whole game.  The two inch black bar is probably the thing that stands
out most as an example of bad programming.  It takes up way to much
room on the screen, and it's only use is to show the score, weapons
left, and a mapping system which shows you where the citizens are; all
of which was done on the regular screen for the S-NES.

Bar aside, the graphics in this game are the same on both versions,
with only a slight color loss on the Sega version being the
difference.  Zombies is not compatible with the six button controller,
which would have been ideal with this type of game.  Assigning
multiple weapons to the top buttons could have added a lot to the game
play.  In the area of sound, the Sega version lacks the same
instrumental quality that the S-NES Zombies had, and the sound effects
seemed to be shorter with a scratchy digitized sound that accompanied
them.  I can understand how the music might be below the S-NES
standards, but allowing the Genesis Zombies to be plagued by a huge
bar really brought this game down.


   Here's How They Stacked Up HEAD TO HEAD :

Overall, the concept and ideas for Zombies showed a lot of originality
on both versions, and the two player option adds a lot to the
re-playability of this game.  But when put side to side, the S-NES
version really outperforms the Sega Zombies in both playability and
overall appearance.  Unlike Mortal Kombat where the Genesis version
had the blood where the S-NES one didn't, the Sega Zombies has no
superior qualities over it's S-NES counterpart, and people who are
interested in buying this game will easily pick up a copy of the Super
Nintendo version over the Sega Genesis version.

Hello all of you GMJers.  If you want to write to us letting us know
what you think of the new version, old version, how much you hate us
or love us, or have any video game questions that you hope to be
published, write to us at the addresses above.  We are trying to set
up ID's for ALL of our writers on these boards, but until we do, just
write to the ID's above.  Everyone sees every letter.  This edition of
Express Mail, we only selected letters strictly magazine related since
the theme seems to be our new version.  Since some of the questions
were really good, we thought it would be a good and simple way to
explain exactly how everything will work.  However, keep sending your
game questions and other such mail because next issue will resume
regular procedures...

*** Slow baud? No problem.
I was on Prodigy and I read some promotional letters from you guys
about the graphic version of the magazine.  I assume it is a big file
and I only have a 2400 modem.  Is there another way to get the new
version?

H. Cavelerio
Westford, Ma

{ Phunky: Just recently we decided to give away the magazine through
{ the mail in addition to the downloads.  All you have to do is write
{ us on any of our boards in which we read mail.  Give us your
{ address and we will send you the print issues monthly.

*** Win-dozer
Why is your new version only for windows? I don't have windows and I
have been with you guys almost the whole time! Now you exclude me?
THANKS A LOT!

Norman Lewis
Boston, Ma

{ Phunky:
{ Hey Norm, CALM DOWN! We reconfigured the whole project.  At first it
{ was only going to be for windows, but we found some better ways of
{ doing the mag.  Now anyone with a PC can view our mag through DOS!

*** But, you aren't EGM!
GMJ rules, don't get me wrong.  But we need some overseas coverage.  I
want to know what's coming, when it's coming and how much it's gonna
be!

Michael Watson
Boston, Ma

{ Phunky:
{ Mike, I guess you will be a very happy camper as you read the
{ upcoming issue of GMJ.  We are expanding into a full coverage
{ magazine.  Look for upcoming game lists, Japanese news, sales and
{ rental figures and a lot more!

*** Recent fan wants pictures
I've been a follower of your mag ever since issue #23, and I've seen
great improvements in both the layout and overall quality of the
reviews.  Your info is out months before the other published mags, so
I really don't have a reason to buy them anymore.  The only problem I
see is that you can't have pictures of the games online.  Other than
that, GMJ is my favorite video gaming mag on and it's free!! Keep up
the good work.

Ben Croxford
Boston, Ma

{ Phunky:
{ Well Ben, your prayers have been answered.  Starting this issue, we
{ have a monthly Electronic Print version of the Game Master Journal.
{ We have expanded coverage, full color pictures, a professional
{ layout and anything else you would find in those other $5 mags,
{ except we are free, and we will be offering even more than they
{ will, including several things that just CAN'T be done with regular

Hey SFII fans, it's renew your lease on your Genesis...AGAIN! Quite
possibly one of the most amazing feats accomplished on the Genesis so
far is the latest version of SFII from Capcom.  Every year, you think
that the good old Genny is just a little too outdated, but bang,
programming hits a new level and you keep it for another year.  Games
like SFIISCE keep Sega players happy, and the video game market going.

Judging by the name, you may think it is just the Champion Edition
standing alone, however just like on the SNES, the Turbo and Hyper
Fighting options are included.  But unlike the SNES version, the Sega
version packs a tournament option.

When you first snag this cart of the shelf and plug it in to your
Genesis, there is simply nothing that is going to fully prepare you
for what you are going to experience.  Every last animation is here,
perfectly translated to the Sega format.  Choose from any of the 12
characters in either of their snazzy uniforms (depending what mode you
are playing in).  The backgrounds amazingly enough look spectacular
even in the 64 color display.  The smooth parallax scrolling,
simulating 3D effect and the soft textured presentation of the
characters are only a small part of this flickerless phenomenon.

Anyone planning on picking this cart up, should really consider buying
one of Sega's little 6 button controllers to go with it.  Not only
does the controller give you true arcade control for a great price
($20), but it is also the best available controller on the market
priced under $40.  With the 6 button controller, this is the best
playing version of the game yet.  Too bad this game was not made
compatible with Sega's upcoming 4 player adapter, the tournament mode
would have fit so perfectly.

The tournament mode is a great opportunity for you and your buddies to
get together and find out who the real champ is.  There are 2 tourney
options.  The first one allows each person competing to select 6
different fighters to use.  Whoever wins the most matches is obviously
the winner.  This mode is great to show up those 1 dimensional players
who can only use one or two characters.  The second mode, the
Elimination Mode, allows to select from one to six characters.  You
fight one round battles and whoever defeats all their opponents first
wins.

If speed is what you need, you will be exuberantly excited to find out
that just like the SNES version, this version is actually faster than
the arcade since you can choose from a total of ten speeds (no code
necessary this version).

Ahh, there had to be one downer.  The voices.  Although the music is
pretty good the voices and sound effects were completely horrible.  A
disappointing con since we have seen a lot of great effects and sounds
on other previous Genny carts.  I assume this was all due to lack of
memory.  Even at 24 meg, they ran out of room to improve on the sound,
but that is ok because the rest of the game is near perfect.

It's finally here folks.  Many thought it would never come, but it did
and in a big way.  SFIISCE is one of the hottest carts this year on
the Genesis with amazing graphics, control and speed.  Only thing I
can say that is wrong with it besides the sound, is that it was based
on the SNES version, not the arcade.  The characters are small just
like on the SNES and they did not truly add the Turbo
backgrounds...however, this is GENESIS!

        Here's how they stacked up HEAD TO HEAD:

For some nitty gritty comparisons, you should check out our review
last issue of the SNES version, but here are some of the points we
came up with.

o The Genesis version is just as fast with no code needed.
o The characters are animated just as well, and graphics are just as
  spectacular.
o The SNES version has a much brighter and colorful appearance and
  that is hands down a big plus.
o The sound on the SNES version is great, the voices are ok, but the
  both the sound and voices on the Genny version rotted!
o The control was great on both versions.  With the 6 button
  controller, the Genesis version played better.  Using the 3 button
  controller, the SNES version played better.  The music was really
  good on both version, but I have to give the SNES version the edge.
o Both versions offer small characters, and unfinished backgrounds.
o The Genesis version offers a great tournament mode not found on any
  other version.

Ranger-X represents what an older concept along with newer technology
can create and along with it a new realm in video gaming.  Space
shooters have been used time and time again, but Ranger-X from Gao (a
new Sega development team) twists the idea along with a side scrolling
shooter to make a game that is actually original in today's market.

Your character is a huge metal suited figure, equipped with a standard
blaster and a second weapon which can be switched at any time in the
game.  This second weapon has it's own power meter which drops when
it's being used.  An Ex-Up vehicle follows along behind you and can
become a part of you by standing on it and pressing down to crouch
inside the vehicle.  While on the Ex-Up you can choose what your
second weapon is from an assortment of lasers to a flame thrower.  The
Ex-Up automatically follows your character throughout the level, and
with the six button controller, you can control it by using the top
buttons.

Flying is a big part of this game as your main guy can take to the air
because of the engine hooked up to your back.  The engine is limited
to just a few seconds of flying, but with practice, hovering in one
place can make it so you're in the air for longer periods of time.
Your character and the other motorized attackers all animate very
fluidly on screen, and the amount of color and parallax scrolling on
the levels in incredible.  Each level has you going after a series of
targets that must be destroyed before going onto the boss encounter.
Some levels have you going on one set path, while others like level
two have you exploring certain areas to find the targets.

The button combinations are unique in that button A makes you face
left and let's you fire in that direction, while button C faces you
right.  Button B uses the special weapon and up takes you to the
skies.  The backgrounds in this game all use a tremendous amount of
color, and the foregrounds and sprites all use color effectively.  The
explosions are realistic looking, which is a given for a shooter style
game.  The popular use of parallax found in the floor of the Street
Fighter II levels can be found here in level three with a 3-D tunnel
that looks like you're really walking past it.  This might not add
much to the actual game, but it's great for the visual aspect of the
game.

The music is some phunky tunes that fit into this game perfectly.
Listening to this game with a pair of headphones really adds to the
game because it makes you feel like you're in the game.  The
explosions shake the house literally, and the gunfire is represented
with realistic digitized sounds.  Other newsworthy portions of this
game include some software scaling of some enemy ships and at the
beginning of each level a series of lines that represent building
scales and rotates around the screen and scale toward the viewer.

The downsides of Ranger-X include the very hard nature of the game and
the awkward controls that take time to master and to feel comfortable
with.  The good points are the great graphics and presentation of the
levels and the overwhelming sounds that happen during the action.  The
addition of the Ex-Up really improves the game-play of the game, and
the bosses and enemies all seem to come at you at once.  Ranger-X has
some great strategic levels, and is a game for the hard core gamer
that can beat most games on hard.  Along with Gunstar Heroes, Sega
seems to be focusing a lot of attention on action games now-a-days
which means we'll be seeing a lot of good quality games come Christmas
time.  Ranger-X is just superb.

Sr. Jnx-90
The sights and sounds in Ranger-X just blew me away! The Ex-Up rover
was a great idea that can be used as an option in future games.  The
scaling lines in-between levels weren't needed, and the difficulty was
just too hard for most gamers.

Mr. Mojo Risin'-92
This game just simply rocks!! Everything is perfect from the huge
amount of colors to the great sound effects.

Leave all your premonitions and beliefs of what your Sega Genesis can
do in the closet, because Sega has probably destroyed every boundary
of what the Genesis is "supposed to do" in it's newest game, Gunstar
Heroes.  Gunstar is in a league of it's own; never before have a
combination of graphics, sound, game-play, software techniques, and
overall fun been all applied to the same game with such magnitude.

Gunstar Heroes is the newest side-scrolling action game to be released
on the Genesis, and while not having the popular movie names to it or
any flashy ad campaigns, has succeeded in mixing the perfect blend of
non-stop action and game-play into one 8-meg cart.  The on-screen
action can only be described as furious, with as many as ten enemies
on screen at once, and clocked at speeds just under a weighted down
Sonic.  Enemies come from everywhere, and attack from just about every
point of angle on the screen.

At the beginning of the game you get to choose your characters
fighting style; either being able to fire your weapon as you run or an
option that makes you have to stand still while you fire your weapon.
Next, you get to choose which of the four beginning levels you'll
start out at, and then a quick rundown on the level you chose.  From
here on out is non-stop action that has to be seen to be believed.

There are four primary weapons in Gunstar: a laser, a fire thrower, a
seek and destroy weapon, and a flame thrower.  The weapons are spread
out all around the levels and can be upgraded by finding and picking
up that weapons icon.  An original idea used in this game is that the
weapons can be mixed so that a brand new weapon is made (ie.  if you
pick up the fire thrower and the tracking weapon, the weapon becomes a
huge line of flame that seeks out enemies.) This new weapon set-up
makes for some great trial and error situations where you must decide
which weapon must be used in what situation.

Scaling and rotation have never looked this good on the Sega Genesis.
Through software techniques, almost flawless rendering of objects is
possible.  Most of the bosses use at least some special technique in
the way they attack or more around the screen.  One such boss is a
series of boxes in the form of a human figure which rotates around the
screen and has the most lifelike movements that I've ever seen in a
box.  The rest of the graphics in this game are cartoonish in nature,
but are done with superb color usage and some great animations.  A lot
of detail went into the making of this game, with great shading and
backgrounds on all of the levels, and a lot of attention in keeping
the action intense at all points in the game.

The first four levels can be beaten in any order, and doing so is no
cake walk.  Each level has several mini-bosses and an end boss that
makes you use all the skills of the character.  Your character can
shoot in any direction, be it up, down, sideways, or in any diagonal
direction.  Your character can also do a slide sweep which takes a lot
of damage off the enemies, and a combination of a throw or a body
slam/jump kick.  Hanging from ceilings and ledges is also possible,
and aerial throws and combinations are also possible.  Two of the
levels have you riding in a separate vehicle; one being in a scooter
that can defy gravity, and the other one in a spaceship for a mini
outer space shooter.  Game-play has never reached these heights, with
an improvement only possible with the use of a six button capability
not found in this game.  The levels themselves also have unique things
to cling from and to climb on.  One level is set on an aircraft in the
sky while another is a huge monopoly game with multiple baddies to
beat up on.  Older twists such as reappearing bosses has also been
used so that the boss count in this game is over fifteen guys.

Games with great graphics or a lot software techniques usually end up
having one area of the game being less than standard.  This is not
true with Gunstar though, because the music and sounds in this game
are THE best I've ever heard on the Genesis.  The background music
pounds out some hard rock tunes while the on screen action is heard
with some heart stopping explosions and non-stop gunfire.  Every
action has it's own sound effect so your neighbors may complain that
there's a war going on in your bedroom.

One feature that I didn't mention above is that Gunstar is a two
player game also.  After testing it out though, we found that some
slow down was found in some levels because of it, but not enough to
hurt the game in any way.  To add to the replay value, Gunstar has the
perfect difficulty curve that actually affects the attacks of the
enemies (ie.  on easy, there are several "spots" where you can stand
when fighting a boss and not get hurt, but while on the other settings
you can get hurt anywhere.) To me, Gunstar is almost the perfect game.
Everything is done to perfection, with action unequaled in any
earlier attempts at a side-scrolling action game, and that is as fun
to watch as it is to be playing.  Hopefully, more games will be made
with this being the game to match in overall quality and
professionalism.  Goods news for us though, because this game is just
screaming sequel.

Phunky Pheel One-96 Wow!
This game sets new standards for video games in general.  Not only are
the graphics some of the best, but the sounds and playability are up
there with other classics like Contra and Mega Man.  To bad the
creators of this game are working on a McDonalds game and not a sequel
to Gunstar Heroes!

Anderson-90
Gunstar Heroes shows that with a lot of programming a game can surpass
the expectations of a system.  I couldn't believe the amount of action
on screen at once.  The two player adaption was a great addition to a
game that needs no improvements and has the best moves this side of
Street Fighter.

Pepperidge Farmer-97
Perfect man, perfect! I've been playing this game non-stop ever since
the GMJ offices got it in.  The many smiles this game gave me is worth
the price, no prob.  One or two more levels would have made this game
a 100.

GENESIS NEWZ CLIP:
Redo it! The preliminary version of Tournament Fighters from Konami on
the Genesis looked pathetic, however after retooling and refining
backgrounds and animation, the Genny version is starting to look up.
The hyped up Eternal Champions from Sega is one of the best looking
games for the holidays.  The new texture techniques used will be
making this one of the most impressive graphical displays on the
Genesis EVER!

Welcome back all to another exciting issue.
This issue we are featuring 2 special reviews of games that appear on
both the SNES and Genesis.  If you have trouble deciding which
version of a game to get, GMJ will now be doing side by side
comparisons of any game that appears on 2 or more systems.  Next
issue you can look forward to over 15 reviews and a special
Electronic Arts insert reviewing ALL the four way play games, as well
as 2 3DO reviews.

Macromdeia announced recently to develop a player which would allow
Director Macintosh or Windows files to be compatible on the 3DO.
This is the first bid to direct the 3DO as a business utility and not
just a video game console.  Marketing the 3DO directly to compete
with Macs and PC's would certainly strenghten the list of pros for
the 3DO as we here at GMJ are not very convinced that the 3DO is
strictly a video game unit.

In Segaland there is many a rumor flying around about the Saturn.
Sega may ditch the old format and hop right on to a 64 bit project
with the same title which would be a CD based unit that would play
Sega CD format games as well as regular Genesis titles.  Our source
for this rumor was very bleak so that is all we can say right now.
If we find any backbone or followup information to that story, you
will be updated...But for what we CAN tell you right now not to
expect this super system until late '94.  At the earliest.

Any Genesis owner who feels depribed for some reason that only SNES
players will be enjoying the horrible SFII/MK ripoff, Clayfighters
can rejoyce.  Interplay, makers of the SNES game Clayfighters has
singed on to the Sega 3rd party crew with a Genesis version of
Clayfighters.

Some possible last second changes to Sonic CD might be a replacement
of the cinema scenes.  We hate to throw another rumor at you but we
have to.  The grapevine has it that the current cinemas to Sonic CD
will be replaced by segments of the Saturday version of the cartoon.
As long as they don't delay the game because of this, I don't care,
otherwise...WHY?!?!

All of you Sega/health freaks (and those two things are just so
complimantary of each other) can have fun with an upcoming excersise
unit from the company Hearbeat.  This unit plugs into the Genesis
control port and its directional controls are hooked up to an
exersise bike (provided by you).  You setup a workout which will be
interactive with a game.  The concept of the packin game (Outback
Joey) is to go through levels and fight off bad guys while mantaining
a certain heart rate.  There may also be an NHL game in development
for this unique attachment...?

Nearly three weeks ago the long awaited Panasonic 3DO multimedia unit
was released nationwide for a retail of $700.  Available for our
hands on test was one pack-in game wad Crash and Burn - a futuristic
racing game.  For what we had been expecting, believe it or not some
at GMJ were somewhat disappointed.  Before you decide to stop reading
our magazine forever though, hear me out.  The scaling, graphics and
manipulation of the objects and backgrounds was incredible, however
the movement and interaction with the car and backgrounds was poorly
done.  Then we thought it was not fair to judge a first title so
strictly, and when compared to say an Altered beast or Super Mario
World (in ratio), it is needless to say that Crash and Burn is a
king.

I was disappointed in the marketing of this unit.  Thrown in every
video game section of every store, the 3DO is now directed as a way
too expensive video game unit, instead of a next wave multimedia
entertainment business and networking unit and possibly the
replacement for VCR and alternate to an expensive PC that it is.
Instead of packing the unit with a keyboard or control panel, the
system is packed with a video game controller and the "bare" system
is not fully capable of running full length full motion video discs.
A special cartridge upgrade has to be installed.  These are all some
major mistakes because at $700 no one is purchasing this system so
they can play Madden football...and if they are, they got some
problems.

Ok, so you are all thinking how bad we are dogging this unit.  NO NO
NO! Not at all.  I am convinced this will be the entertainment unit
of the future hands down.  The possibilities of the 3DO are endless.
We just thought that their marketing approach was all wrong.  Why
should I spend $700 that is not loaded with some of the standard
features it was supposed to COME with when in 9 months another 3DO
system will be released for $500 with internal full motion
capabilities, a keyboard, and a mouse?

Let there be no mistake.  This IS the future of entertainment.  This
is a video game system, interactive TV, fax machine, VCR and more all
in one unit.

Check out next issue where we will give you a FULL coverage report
and review the games.

Lets get right to the chase gang, this is one HELL of a game! The
game that started the craze, Street Fighter, has it's third upgrade
now, this time with new everything! 4 new characters, redrawn
graphics, re-sampled sounds...  it's all here! NEW MOVES TOO!

Unless you have lived in a CAVE for the last 30 months, you know that
the object of Street Fighter is to beat your foe in a
two-out-of-three falls match.  There are SIXTEEN characters to choose
from, each with their own fighting style.  Some throw fireballs, some
are great with their hands while others are blazing fast.  It is up
to you to find a character that best macthes your playing style.

You play against 12 of the 16 characters when you play against the
computer, and the first 11 are randomly selected.  The final
character you face is M.Bison, the evil druglord/dictator of Thailand
who has spread his evil world-wide.

When someone else puts their credits in the machine, the game goes
into a head-to-head mode.  You then must fight to stay on the machine
because the loser goes home!

One of the Game of the Year candidates, this one will blow you away!

Ace - 95
The ONLY problem I had with this game was the fact that the sounds,
although they sound GREAT with Q-sound, are AWEFULLY DONE! This
sounds like a NEO*GEO game! But other than that..  LOOK OUT!

====================================================================
                             WARP ZONE!
====================================================================

SUPER STREET FIGHTER MOVES:  All of the new ones BEFORE EGM,
                             GamePro, VG + Die Hard Game Fan.

NOTE: Although this LOOKS like some posts on the Internet, this is
      NOT a 'steal', we did find these moves, these are OUR strat's
      and all of these moves are listed correctly.  (IF not, tell
      us, and we'll fix it!)


====================================================================
Cammy
====================================================================
Special Moves:
Spear kick:           |  \  --o  +  kick
                      o   o

Spinning Backhand: /  |  \  +  punch
                  o   o   o

Crescent Kick:  --o  |  \  + kick
                     o   o

Pile-driving Suplex (Pileplex):  --o  +  fierce kick
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Back Suplex: --o  +  fierce punch
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Ariel Throw:  --o  +  medium kick

Comments:
Spear Kick: Cammy launxhes herself horizontally, close to the ground,
at the opponent.  This is actually her worst move, but it can be used
it combos very easily.  The only problem with it is that it has
horrible recovery time.  This can be dealt with by doing the short
spear kick from the limit of its range so that while your opponent is
recovering from the block, you can be recovering from the kick.  It
also places you at the maximum distance from the opponent.  It also
only goes about half way across the screen before stopping.  It can
be used to stop projectiles like Blanka and Honda, but it is best
used as a defensive maneuver.

Spinning Backhand: This looks like a quick spin followed by a guile
backhand.  It has the capability of hitting twice, and when it does
it does a great deal of damage.  Secondly, when Cammy is spinning on
her heals she is invincible.  But you have to have perfect timing,
since you are vulnerable before and after this point.  It can be used
like Balrog's TAP to dodge fireballs, but it is more difficult to
time.  Because you move so far forward, you will probably want to use
the jab spinning backhand, otherwise you will end up within sweeping
distance.  The move is fairly slow, but if used correctly, deadly.

Crescent Kick: This is basically a dragon punch with her foot, and it
is her best move.  It has a trajectory that is wider than Ken's
fierce DP, and it is also invincible (except against Ken/Ryu's Dragon
Punch) while going up.  The intital frames are vulnerable, though, so
it cant be used exactly like the DP.

Combos:
    If Ken or Ryu throw a fireball, do the following...
      Spinning Backhand, short kick, Crescent Kick (3 to 5 hit combo)
    If Guile shows Sonic Boom or Dee Jay shows Ace rusher, do...
      Spinning Backhand, Crescent Kick (2 to 4 hit combo)

Overall:
Cammy is one of the best new characters in the game, according to
most people.  She has good speed and air-priority to rival Chun Li.
She seems to be played in the same style as Chun Li, but with the
added advantage of the uppercut-like kick.  She is great at anti-air
defense, also.

====================================================================
T-Hawk
====================================================================
Special Moves:

Mexican Typhoon:        full 360 degrees on joystick + punch
(aka Phi Slamma Jamma)  (like zangief's spinning pile driver)

Condor Dive:  Jump + (all three punches)

Tomahawk Buster:   --o  |  \  +  punch
                        o   o

Face Smash:   --o + fierce punch

Face Chop:   --o + roundhouse

Throw:  medium punch

Comments:
Mexican Typhoon: Hawk grabs you, plams your head like a basketball,
jumps in the air, windmills you in the air 720 degress, then slams
you into the ground head first.  If you want to impress the hell out
of everyone around you, this is the move to do.  It has a pretty
decent range, about the length for dahlsim to throw.

Condor Dive: T-Hawk jumps, then suddenly dives at you like dahlsim's
yoga spear.  This move can be deceptive - try jumping back, then
diving with the condor dive.  It has a good range, but can only be
done on the way up, not on the way down.  It can be useful for
countering fireballs.

Tomahawk Buster: Another version of the DP, but this goes more
diagonal and is not as quick.  It is only invincible for a very short
time at the beginning, then the rest is vulnerable.  The fierce TB
extends really far - farther than ken's DP - and can also hit twice
if close enough.  It has a pretty nasty fall distance, so it can be
risky.  But the delay when you reach the ground is minimal.

Combos:
Roundhouse neck kick- standing forward- fierce tomahawk buster.

The tick standing short - into mexican typhoon seems to work, but not
as well as Zangief's.

Overall:
T-Hawk seems to be a very versatile character.  His biggest weakness
is his speed, but that can be made up for by his big moves.  His
spinning leg sweep is also a nice move, and it executes faster than
Guile's fierce trip.  His kicks have decent range - much better than
Ken, Ryu, Zangief, and Chun Li's, i would say.  His standing forward
is really nice - it has about a Ryu crouching roundhouse range,
sticks out straight, and is fast.

====================================================================
Dee-Jay
====================================================================
Special Moves:

Machine Gun Upper:   |  o  +  (punch, punch, punch...)
                     o  |

Ace Rusher:  --o  +  punch
             (charge)

Hop Step and a Kick:     o--   --o  +  kick
                       (charge?)

Dee Jay Escape:    | + roundhouse kick
                   o
Comments:
Machine Gun Upper: If you hit the button once, you get a jab-like
uppercut.  Tapping a punch button repeatedly after executin the move
will extend the punch further.  It works well as a defensive move, as
it will stop most characters from jumping in.  It is difficult to hit
more than a few times, but it has been done up to four.

Ace Rusher: This looks and works like guile's sonic boom, but is
different because it has a long recovery time and his body leans way
forward when performing it.

Hop Step and a Kick: He sort of kicks, turns around, and kicks again.
Crouching Roundhouse: This is like dahlsim's slide.  It can be used
against someone who is jumping in at you, but unfortunately it cant
go under fireballs.  If the timing is right, you can follow up a
fireball with this.

Combos:
   jumping hit - standing forward - fireball
   jumping hit - standing short - short spinning kick

Overall:
Dee Jay seems to be one of the better characters and will be
especially useful to those who know how to use Guile.  His far
standing fierce is a good anty-air attack, and his jump + roundhouse
hits far enough down to hit Dahlsim's crouching fierce.  His jumps
are his biggest flaw.  The lower part of his body hangs really low,
which makes it hard to jump over fireballs.  Fireball traps seem to
work very well against him, since jumping is difficult and he lacks
any invincible move.

====================================================================
Fei Long
====================================================================

Special Moves:

Triple Punch:   |  \  --o  +  punch (repeat,
                o   o                repeat...)

Flaming Vertical Kick:   o--  |   /  +  kick
                              o  o

Leaping Double Kick:   --o  +  roundhouse

Flip-over throw:   --o +  roundhouse
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Comments:
Triple Punch: Doing the fireball motion once will give you a flaming
jab.  Doing it again quickly will cause him to slide forward a bit
and follow up with a straight punch.  A third time finishes the move
with another punch.  He rushes at you faster than Balrog's rushing
punches, but it is hard to get the timing right to get multiple hits.
Practice makes perfect!

Flaming Kick: He jumps into the air with his leg on fire.  The
horizontal range is non-existant.  The height is determined by which
kick you use.  It is a bit safer than a dragon punch because if you
do it too soon, you might be in a defensive crouch.  If you do it too
late, you will still be blocking.  It seems to be mainly a defensive
move.

Leaping Kick: Fei Long jumps at you with a double kick.  It does
pretty decent damage.  Although he spends a lot of time moving
forward with no attack out, once the attack comes out it has one hell
of a priority.

Combos:
This combo is great against the larger characters (Zangief, Hawk)
Jumping roundhouse, short kick, Triple punch over + over

Overall:
He has the potential to be the next anti-character, like Guile was
for Ken/Ryu.  Use him against characters without projectiles for the
best chance of victory.

===================================================================
Ryu
===================================================================
Dragon Punch: --o | \  + punch
                  o  o

   Still the superior move in the game.  Deadly, but not as damaging.

Red Fireball:   o--  /  |  \  --o  +  punch
                    o   o   o
This is a red fireball that will burn the opponent like Dhalsim's
yoga fire.

Fireball:  | \  --o + punch
           o  o

He has a longer delay after his fireball and his hurricane kick now
starts spinning on the way up and all the way down, following his
jump motion.

Hurricane Kick: |  / o-- + kick
                o o
Air Hurricane Kick: Jump then HK motion

The kick still does tons of damage.  the Air HK now follows the
motion of his normal jump (arced).  The sooner you do the HK motion
during your jump, the higher you'll fly.

====================================================================
Ken
====================================================================
Changes to his DP - fierce now burns opponent and can hit 3 times.
Jab hits once and knocks down.  His hurricane kick is also like
Ryu's.  Does not have a flaming fireball..  but other than that, see
Ryu.

==============================================================================
Chun Li
==============================================================================
Fireball:   o--   --o  +  punch
         (charge)

The new fireball.
ONLY use in a situation where your opponent will definitely either be
hit (like in a combo) or will have to block (such as when an opponent
is just getting up).  The delay AFTER the fireball is even longer
than the delay in HF and the fireball (actually, it looks like a raw
egg being tossed) dissipates (dissapears) before crossing the screen.
The faster the fireball, the shorter the distance.

Helicopter Kick: | (charge) o + kick
                 o          |

The altered Helicopter kick
MUCH better against opponents jumping in, as the animation sequence
where Chun is just beginning to flip over now knocks the opponent
down (doesn't leave them standing to retaliate).  Works great vs.
Ken/Ryu, and Long.  Haven't tried it vs.  anyone else yet.  Her
aerial Helicopter (where she goes into it quickly after jumping) is
strange, but I imagine helpfull against corner traps, as it arcs in
the path of her natural jump, and goes by kinda fast.  This is one of
the more important positive changes made.

Combos:
jumping hit - standing fierce - fireball/lightning kick jumping neck
fierce - standing strong - standing fierce - lightning kick jumping
fierce - standing strong - crouching forward.

==============================================================================
Zangief
==============================================================================
Zangief's Power Moves:  360 spin from forward to down
                        and back around to front and....

    punch       -- old faithful, the SPD (spinning pile driver)
    kick        -- charge throw, or CPD (charge pile driver)
    kick (close)-- drop then flip and leap into air with them,
                       or FPD (flip pile driver)

Knee Drop:  o (hold) + fierce
            |

     No more one-hit dizzy.

Air Throws: He has TWO air throws
    fierce (and forward)--almost exactly like Z's old crouch strong throw,
       but in the air.
    roundhouse (and forward)--almost exactly like his old crouch fierce, but
       in the air--nabs them and with no pause heaves them in the air over
       his shoulder (doesn't look up like he did before)

Throws: finally got all but one normal throw checked out.
         Strong--simple pile driver from before.
         Fierce--iron claw aka far+strong from older versions
        Forward--new suplex ala fierce from older versions--heaves opponent
                 over head, then falls back, but this time he ends up
                 horizontal about 1 inch from the ground, and then you fall
down.
     Roundhouse--chin smash ala far+fierce from before
  crouch fierce--gut wrench as older versions.


==============================================================================
Blanka
==============================================================================
Blanka Ball: o--  --o + punch
          (charge)

  Still one of the fastest moves in the game.

Vertical Ball: | (charge) o + kick
               o          |

Flip Roll:  o--   --o  +  kick
        (charge)

Blanka flips back, then does a roll that has an arc to it.  If timed
right, it can go over fireballs.

He is improved in someways, DIES in others.  He now stops rolling in
his vertical roll and goes back down at an angle so he cant be swept
or dragon punched so easily.  Also, the timing of his rolls are such
that, if blocked, a quick fireball will hit it on the way down.

====================================================================
Honda
====================================================================
Thousand Hand Slap: Punch buttons over and over

   Great for corner-trapping.

Banzai Drop: | (charge) o + kick
             o          |

==============================================================================
Guile
==============================================================================
Sonic Boom:  o--  --o + punch
           (charge)

   An ever BETTER recovery than before!

Flash Kick (aka Razor Kick):  | (charge) o + kick
                              o          |

  The range for this has been dropped a bit.  More defensive now.

Mid-Air Back Breaker: --o + punch

Pretty good priority.  Watch out for mis-timing..  you need to be
almost touching to pull the move off.

====================================================================
Dhalsim
====================================================================
Dhalsim Disappear:
   --o | \  + punch  OR o-- |  / + punch
       o  o   kick          o o    kick

Either forward DRP will put you in front of your foe, either backward
will put you behind him or her.  Punch = far away, kick = near.

Fireball: | \  --o + punch
          o  o

   Just as good as Ken and Ryu's!

Yoga Flame: o-- / | \  --o
               o  o  o

   This hangs around for a LONG while!

====================================================================
Balrog
====================================================================
Buffalo Headbutt:   |   o  +  punch
                    o   |
               (charge)
   Yet another variation on the DP.

Charge Punch: o-- --o + punch = straight
               (charge) kick  = uppercut

Turn Around Punch: HOLD ALL 3 KICK then let go

This move no longer lets you go through fireballs.

Here's the bottom line:
        Power DOWN.

Against anyone w/o a fireball, Balrog will roast 'em.  Easy.
Against anyone WITH a fireball, well, you're gonna have to work.  And
hard.

Overall, he's still a power to face.... if you use him, good luck.

====================================================================
Vega
====================================================================
Air Spiral:   |  o  or o +  punch
              o   \   /
          (charge)
Vega jumps off the wall like he is going to do a claw dive, but then
dives head first across the screen in mid air.  He picks the wall
depending on where you point (up-left or up-right.)

Spread Eagle: |    o +  punch
              o    |
            (charge)

Wall Dive - Suplex: |          o  + kick, then PUNCH when near
                    o (charge) |                     your foe.

====================================================================
Sagat
====================================================================
Tiger Shots:  | \  --o + punch = high Tiger Shot
              o  o       kick  = low Tiger Shot

Tiger Uppercut: --o | \  + punch
                    o  o
                 o
Tiger Knee: / | /  + kick
           o  o

  About the only change is that his tiger knee now goes further.

====================================================================
Bison
====================================================================
Flying Dive:  |  o  +  punch
              o  |
          (charge)
He jumps really high and then comes down and hits you on the head
with his fist.

Anti-Grav Kick: |  o +  kick
                o  |
              (charge)

Still defies gravity with this jump, after it hits you can attack
again in mid-air!

Bison Torpedo :      o--    --o + punch
(aka Psycho Chrusher) (charge)

   Only hits at MOST 3 times.

  Scissor Kick: o--  --o + kick
            (charge)

   Always a knock-down move!

Principles of Constitutional Construction

Constitutional interpretation, or constitutional construction, the term more
often used by the Founders, is the process by which meanings are assigned to
words in a constitution, to enable legal decisions to be made that are justified
by it. Some scholars distinguish between "interpretation" â€” assigning meanings
based on the meanings in other usages of the terms by those the writers and
their readers had probably read, and "construction" â€” inferring the meaning from
a broader set of evidence, such as the structure of the complete document from
which one can discern the function of various parts, discussion by the drafters
or ratifiers during debate leading to adoption ("legislative history"), the
background of controversies in which the terms were used that indicate the
concerns and expectations of the drafters and ratifiers, alternative wordings
and their meanings accepted or rejected at different points in development, and
indications of meanings that can be inferred from what is not said, among other
methods of analysis.

There is also a question of whether the meanings should be taken from the public
meanings shared among the literate populace, the private meanings used among the
drafters and ratifiers that might not have been widely shared, or the public
legal meanings of terms that were best known by more advanced legal scholars of
the time. Most of the U.S. Constitution appears to have been written to be
understood by ordinary people of that era, although people then were much more
literate in the law than people are now. However, many of its words and phrases
are fairly deep legal terms that were only well understood by a few of the
legally educated Founders, even though the general population probably had a
rudimentary understanding of them.

There is a problem with the "original public meaning" formulation, because while the meanings of constitutional terms were "public" in the sense that they were not "private" or "secret", they were not necessarily familiar to ordinary people of the era. More accurate would be "legally educated and still learning public meaning", because many of the Founders themselves used terms that they had to research to find the meanings of. An example of this can be seen in the comments by Dickenson in the Federal Convention Aug. 29, 1787, about ex post facto only applying to criminal cases, after researching the topic in Blackstone's Commentaries. So since we can presume the Founders mostly agreed on the writers they considered authoritative on legal usages, we can reasonably refer to the writings of those other writers to find the meanings the Founders intended even if the Founders themselves had not yet done the research to fully master the concepts.

For constitutional terms the denotata are not empirical objects so much as ideas, that is, mental models, that do not, for the most part, have the advantage of some formal scientific models of being representable in mathematical or computer formalisms that we can examine externally. In particular, they are ideas that existed in the minds of persons long dead, so we have to develop mental models of their mental models ("theory of mind") based on the things they read and wrote. That can be done. The verification comes with being able to predict what one of them will say in a writing one hasn't read yet. Becoming adept at doing so can reassure one that one has "gotten into their heads". But that is not something one can demonstrate to others.

This leads to the admonition that the English used in the Constitution and other
legal documents of the 18th century should be read as a foreign language,
putting aside today's meanings of what seem to be the same words we use today,
and attempting to decode the meanings from various clues we can find. This is
not only wise for 18th century English, but for almost any communications, even
among people who communicate with one another daily, because no two people mean
precisely the same thing by the same words on every occasion. When both speaker
and listener are alive they are able to interrogate one another to arrive at a
common meaning, but when the author is dead we have to find evidence in other
things he or his correspondents wrote.

Constitutional controversies are about whether an official act is consistent with, and authorized by, a constitution or constitutional statute or court decision. Since a constitution is a law, and the supreme law within its domain, and authorizes statutes and other official acts which have a textual expression, the principles of constitutional interpretation are essentially the same as the principles of statutory or judicial interpretation.

Most legal scholars recognize seven main methods of judicial decisionmaking:
textual, historical, functional, doctrinal, prudential, equitable,
and natural, although they may differ on what each includes, and
there is some overlap among them.

   1. Textual. Decision based on the actual words of the written
     law, if the meaning of the words is unambiguous. Since a law is
     a command, then it must mean what it meant to the lawgiver,
     and if the meaning of the words used in it have changed since it
     was issued, then textual analysis must be of the words as
     understood by the lawgiver, which for a constitution would be
     the understanding of the ratifying convention or, if that is
     unclear, of the drafters. Some Latin maxims: A verbis legis
     non est recedendum. From the words of the law there is not
     any departure. 5 Coke 118. Noscitur ï¿½sociis. Meaning of
     words may be ascertained by associated words. 3 T.R. 87.

   2. Historical. Decision based less on the actual words than on
     the understanding revealed by analysis of the history of the
     drafting and ratification of the law, for constitutions and
     statutes, sometimes called its legislative history, and for judicial
     edicts, the case history. A textual analysis for words whose
     meanings have changed therefore overlaps historical analysis.
     It arises out of such Latin maxims as Animus hominis est
     anima scripti. Intention is the soul of an instrument. 3 Bulst.
     67.

   3. Functional. Also called structural. Decision based on
     analysis of the structures the law constituted and how they are
     apparently intended to function as a coherent, harmonious
     system. A Latin maxim is Nemo aliquam partem recte
     intelligere potest antequam totum perlegit. No one can
     properly understand a part until he has read the whole. 3 Coke
     Rep. 59.

   4. Doctrinal. Decision based on prevailing practices or opinions
     of legal professionals, mainly legislative, executive, or judicial
     precedents, according to the meta-doctrine of stare decisis,
     which treats the principles according to which court decisions
     have been made as not merely advisory but as normative.
     Some Latin maxims are: Argumentum ï¿½simili valet in lege.
     An argument from a like case avails in law. Coke, Littleton,
     191. Consuetudo et communis assuetudo ... interpretatur
     legem scriptam, si lex sit generalis. Custom and common
     usage ... interpret the written law, if it be general. Jenk. Cent.
     273. Cursus curiï¿½est lex curiï¿½ The practice of the court is
     the law of the court. 3 Buls. 53. Judiciis posterioribus fides
     est adhibenda. Credit is to be given to the latest decisions. 13
     Coke 14. Res judicata pro veritate accipitur. A thing
     adjudicated is received as true. Coke, Littleton, 103.

   5. Prudential. Decision based on factors external to the law or
     interests of the parties in the case, such as the convenience of
     overburdened officials, efficiency of governmental operations,
     avoidance of stimulating more cases, or response to political
     pressure. One such consideration, avoidance of disturbing a
     stable body of practices, is also the main motivation for the
     doctrinal method. It also includes such considerations as
     whether a case is "ripe" for decision, or whether lesser or
     administrative remedies have first been exhausted. A Latin
     maxim is Boni judicis est lites dirimere. The duty of a good
     judge is to prevent litigation. 4 Coke 15.

   6. Equitable. Also called ethical. Decision based on an innate
     sense of justice, balancing the interests of the parties, and what
     is right and wrong, regardless of what the written law might
     provide. Often resorted to in cases in which the facts were not
     adequately anticipated or provided for by the lawgivers. Some
     scholars put various balancing tests of interests and values in
     the prudential category, but it works better to distinguish
     between prudential as balancing the interests and values of
     the legal system from equitable as balancing the interests and
     values of the parties. It arises out of the Latin maxim, ï¿½uitas
     est perfecta quï¿½am ratio quï¿½jus scriptum interpretatur
     et emendat; nulla scriptura comprehensa, sed sola ratione
     consistens. Equity is a sort of perfect reason which interprets
     and amends written law; comprehended in no code, but
     consistent with reason alone. Coke, Littleton, 24.

   7. Natural. Decision based on what is required or advised by
     the laws of nature, or perhaps of human nature, and on what is
     physically or economically possible or practical, or on what is
     actually likely to occur. This has its origin in such ancient Latin
     maxims as: Jura naturï¿½sunt immutabilia. The laws of
     nature are unchangeable. Jacob. 63. Impossibilium nulla
     obligatio est. There is no obligation to do impossible things.
     D. 50, 17, 185. Lex non cogit ad impossibilia. The law does
     not compel the impossible. Hob. 96. Lex neminem cogit ad
     vana seu inutilia peragenda. The law requires no one to do
     vain or useless things. 5 Coke 21. Legibus sumptis
     desinentibus, lege naturï¿½utendum est. Laws of the state
     failing, we must act by the law of nature. 2 Rol. Rep. 98. 

Of these, only the first three, textual, historical, and functional, are methods
of interpreting or constructing the written constitution of government, and the
historical and functional methods may be more a matter of construction than
interpretation. The last, natural, is construction (not interpretation) of the
unwritten constitution of nature, or the unwritten constitution of society,
which form a hierarchy of authority, with the constitution of nature superior to
the constitution of society, and the constitution of society superior to the
written constitution of government. The doctrinal, prudential, and equitable
methods are not interpretion or construction of any of these constitutions,
although judges often claim they are. There is an misguided tendency among
modern judges to misrepresent what are essentially prudential or equitable
decisions as constitutional constructions. Too many lawyers are complicit in
this by casting what are essentially prudential or equitable arguments into
constitutional terms. There is nothing inherently wrong with making prudential
or equitable decisions. The U.S. Constitution confers both law and equity
jurisdictions on federal courts, as do the state constitutions. The problem
comes with treating such decisions as establishing precedents, especially
binding ones. It is one thing to treat a decision as a precedent that clarifies
some ambiguity in the constitution, but quite another to essentially insert a
prudential or equitable decision into the constitution as a kind of amendment.
Such decisions must not conflict with constitutions or constitutional statutes,
but often do. Doctrinal and prudential decisions are more troublesome. The
doctrinal method may be compatible with the written constitution of government
if it merely involves clarifications of ambiguities in the original text, but
not when those doctrines depart from original legal understanding, as they
sometimes do.[1] The prudential method may be justifiable as necessary to handle
large caseloads, but often neglect to render justice in particular cases,
especially when they involve avoidance of controversy rather than a desire to
settle all issues brought before the court.

Within these methods, we can, by study of the writings of the
Founders, and the writings they read, elicit such principles for
interpreting or constructing the Constitution for the United States as the following:

   1. The Constitution is the written document. Although it may
     be considered to include the understandings of its words as of
     the time of ratification, it does not include the subsequent body
     of practices or precedents upon which constitutional decisions
     might be based, which may or may not be consistent with it, or
     authorized by it. The written document refers to itself as "this
     Constitution", and provides for only four methods by which it
     may be amended, all of which apply only to the written
     document.

   2. The authority for provisions of the Constitution is the
     ratifications and state admissions. Current consent or
     acquiescence, or lack thereof, to the Constitution or any
     practice, does not affect the original constitutive acts, and has
     no authority, unless expressed through adoption of
     amendments as provided in Article V.

   3. Provisions of the Constitution are mutually consistent.
     There are no internal logical contradictions, except that a 
     provision of an amendment inconsistent with a previous 
     provision supersedes that provision.

   4. None of the words are without force and effect, except those 
     superseded by amendments, unless such amendments are repealed. 
     Except for the statement of purpose in the preamble, every word was
     intended by the Framers to be legally normative, and not just
     advisory, declaratory, aspirational, or exhortatory. Verba intelligi 
     ut aliquid operantur debent. Words should be interpreted to give 
     them some effect.

   5. Rights and powers are complementary. Every right
     recognized by the Constitution is an immunity, that is, a right
     against a positive action by government, and is equivalent to a
     restriction on delegated powers. Conversely, every delegated
     power is a restriction on immunities. An immunity may be
     expressed either as a declaration of the right, or as a restriction
     on powers.

   6. There are no redundancies within the original
     unamended Constitution. However, amendments may be
     alternative ways of expressing equivalent content in the original
     unamended Constitution or previous amendments. More
     specifically, the Bill of Rights added no new content not
     implicit in the original unamended Constitution, except the
     twenty dollar rule of the Seventh Amendment.

   7. The Constitution was intended to define a functionally
     complete and harmonious system. That does not mean,
     however, that all powers anyone might think the nation or any
     branch, level, office or department should have, were actually
     delegated.

   8. Original "intent" is functional, not motivational. The
     private motives of the Framers or Founders are irrelevant and
     largely unknowable, and likely to have been diverse. The
     common law rule of interpretation understood by the Founders
     was to discern the functional role of elements of the law, not
     the private purposes of the lawgivers.

   9. The ratification debates are the best evidence of
     original understanding. The arguments of those opposed to
     ratification are not just the positions of the losers in the
     debates, which some might dismiss as not indicative of original
     understanding. As the debates proceeded, understandings
     evolved and clarified, and positions changed. Most opponents
     were satisfied by adoption of a Bill of Rights, and by
     assurances by the proponents concerning how the words of
     the Constitution would be interpreted, and those assurances
     must be considered part of the original understanding. That
     means that a construction to which the more significant
     "anti-federalists" would object is almost certainly incorrect.

  10. Powers are narrow, rights broad. The entire theme and
     tenor of the ratification debates was that delegated powers
     were to be interpreted as strictly as possible, consistent with
     the words, and rights as broadly as possible, with the
     presumption in favor of the right, and the burden of proof on
     those claiming a power. Potestas stricte interpretatur. A
     power is strictly interpreted. In dubiis, non prï¿½umitur pro
     potentia. In cases of doubt, the presumption is not in favor of
     a power.

  11. Delegated powers cannot be subdelegated. The U.S.
     Constitution vests all legislative powers in Congress, and all
     judicial powers in the Supreme Court and inferior courts,
     except as specifically expressed. Executive branch officials
     may subdelegate but must remain responsible for the actions of
     their subordinates. There can be no authority exercised that is
     not accountable through constitutional officials.Delegata
     potestas non potest delegari. A delegated power cannot be
     delegated. 9 Inst. 597.

  12. The power to regulate is not the power to prohibit all
     modalities of something. It is only the power to issue
     prescriptions to "make regular", enforceable only by
     deprivations of property or privileges, not of life, limb, or
     liberty. There must always be some modality that is not
     prohibited.

  13. Implied powers are only to "carry into Execution" an
     expressed power and not to do whatever is necessary to
     achieve the intent for which a power might be exercised.
     Delegation of a power is delegation of the right to make a
     certain kind of effort, not to do whatever is necessary to get a
     desired outcome.

  14. There can be no common law crimes. They are in conflict
     with the prohibitions on ex post facto laws and bills of
     attainder.

  15. Rights may not be disabled or unduly burdened by
     legislative or executive process. "Due" process is judicial
     only, involving the granting of a petition to disable a right of the
     defendant, with the burden of proof on the plaintiff or
     prosecutor, and with the defendant having at least those
     minimum protections that prevailed during the Founding. with
     similar disablements having similar standards of proof and
     protection.

  16. There is no right without a remedy. Ubi jus ibi
     remedium. There must always be an accessible forum in
     which a complainant has oyer and terminer for any petition. 

  17.  The Founders were learning. "Original meaning" is not just about what the Founders consciously meant at the moment of ratification, but includes what they would discover with further study of the legal tradition they invoked in the words they chose. Thus, they referred to authors like Blackstone and Coke when they were unsure what they meant, and so must we.

  18.  Early practice indicative but not dispositive. Early practice by the Founders may provide evidence of their aspirations in the words they chose, but should not be regarded as perfect expressions of their intent. Practice can represent compromise with practical concerns and may lag behind the ideals contained in the words.

  19.Â Mental models of mental models. Each of us has a mental model of the world that includes a model of the mental models others have of the world. Communication is possible only to the extent that our mental models of the mental models of others are somehow accurate or congruent. When a lawgiver issues a law, a command to others for future compliance, he is relying on others to understand his words the way he does, and those others are relying on him to use words with the meanings they have for them. But words are an imperfect way to convey meanings, and if the recipient of the command cannot interrogate the lawgiver for his meaning, he must try to improve his mental model of the lawgiver's mental model by such means as learning to accurately predict what the lawgiver will write about matters the recipient has not previously read.

  20.Â Find the right level of abstraction. It was common for the Founders to use somewhat more concrete words to mean broader principles. Thus, "press" or "arms" is not limited to the technology of the time, but refers to the general function they served. "Militia" does not mean merely those legally obliged to respond to an official call-up, but defense activity generally.

A more complete discussion of these principles is best done by
reference to Landmark Court Decisions.

This document is a brief introduction to TCP/IP, followed by advice on
what to read for more information.  This  is  not  intended  to  be  a
complete  description.    It  can  give  you  a reasonable idea of the
capabilities of the protocols.  But if you need to know any details of
the  technology,  you  will  want  to  read  the  standards  yourself.
Throughout the text, you will find references to the standards, in the
form of "RFC" or "IEN" numbers.  These are document numbers. The final
section of this  document  tells  you  how  to  get  copies  of  those
standards.



1. What is TCP/IP?


TCP/IP  is a set of protocols developed to allow cooperating computers
to share resources across a network.  It was developed by a  community
of  researchers centered around the ARPAnet.  Certainly the ARPAnet is
the best-known TCP/IP network.  However as of June, 87, at  least  130
different  vendors  had products that support TCP/IP, and thousands of
networks of all kinds use it.

First some basic definitions.  The most accurate name for the  set  of
protocols we are describing is the "Internet protocol suite".  TCP and
IP are two of the protocols in this suite.  (They  will  be  described
below.)    Because  TCP and IP are the best known of the protocols, it
has become common to use the term TCP/IP or IP/TCP  to  refer  to  the
whole  family.  It is probably not worth fighting this habit.  However
this can lead to some oddities.  For example, I  find  myself  talking
about  NFS as being based on TCP/IP, even though it doesn't use TCP at
all.  (It does use IP.  But it  uses  an  alternative  protocol,  UDP,
instead  of TCP.  All of this alphabet soup will be unscrambled in the
following pages.)

The Internet is a  collection  of  networks,  including  the  Arpanet,
NSFnet, regional networks such as NYsernet, local networks at a number
of University and research institutions,  and  a  number  of  military
networks.  The term "Internet" applies to this entire set of networks.
The subset of them that is managed by the  Department  of  Defense  is
referred  to  as the "DDN" (Defense Data Network).  This includes some
research-oriented networks, such as  the  Arpanet,  as  well  as  more
strictly  military  ones.    (Because much of the funding for Internet
protocol developments is done via  the  DDN  organization,  the  terms
Internet  and  DDN  can  sometimes  seem  equivalent.)    All of these
networks are connected to each other.  Users can  send  messages  from
any  of  them  to  any other, except where there are security or other
policy restrictions on access.    Officially  speaking,  the  Internet
protocol  documents  are  simply  standards  adopted  by  the Internet
community for its own use.  More recently, the Department  of  Defense
issued a MILSPEC definition of TCP/IP.  This was intended to be a more
formal definition, appropriate for use in  purchasing  specifications.
However  most  of  the  TCP/IP community continues to use the Internet
standards.  The MILSPEC version is intended to be consistent with it.

Whatever it is called, TCP/IP is a family of protocols.  A few provide
                                  1
 


"low-level" functions needed for many applications.  These include IP,
TCP, and UDP.  (These will be described in a bit more  detail  later.)
Others are protocols for doing specific tasks, e.g. transferring files
between computers, sending mail, or finding out who is  logged  in  on
another   computer.      Initially  TCP/IP  was  used  mostly  between
minicomputers or mainframes.  These machines had their own disks,  and
generally  were self-contained.  Thus the most important "traditional"
TCP/IP services are:

   - file transfer.  The file transfer protocol (FTP) allows a user on
     any computer to get files from another computer, or to send files
     to another computer.  Security is handled by requiring  the  user
     to  specify  a  user  name  and  password for the other computer.
     Provisions are made for handling file transfer  between  machines
     with different character set, end of line conventions, etc.  This
     is not quite the same thing as more recent "network file  system"
     or  "netbios"  protocols, which will be described below.  Rather,
     FTP is a utility that you run any time you want to access a  file
     on  another  system.    You  use  it to copy the file to your own
     system.  You then work with the local copy.   (See  RFC  959  for
     specifications for FTP.)

   - remote  login.    The network terminal protocol (TELNET) allows a
     user to log in on any other computer on the network.  You start a
     remote session by specifying a computer to connect to.  From that
     time until you finish the session, anything you type is  sent  to
     the  other  computer.   Note that you are really still talking to
     your own computer.  But the telnet program effectively makes your
     computer invisible while it is running.  Every character you type
     is sent directly to the other system.  Generally, the  connection
     to  the  remote  computer  behaves much like a dialup connection.
     That is, the remote system will ask you to  log  in  and  give  a
     password, in whatever manner it would normally ask a user who had
     just dialed it up.  When you log off of the other  computer,  the
     telnet  program exits, and you will find yourself talking to your
     own computer.  Microcomputer implementations of telnet  generally
     include  a  terminal  emulator  for some common type of terminal.
     (See RFC's 854 and 855 for specifications for  telnet.    By  the
     way,  the  telnet protocol should not be confused with Telenet, a
     vendor of commercial network services.)

   - computer mail.  This allows you to  send  messages  to  users  on
     other  computers.    Originally, people tended to use only one or
     two specific computers.  They  would  maintain  "mail  files"  on
     those machines.  The computer mail system is simply a way for you
     to add a message to another user's mail file.    There  are  some
     problems  with  this  in  an environment where microcomputers are
     used.  The most serious is that a micro is  not  well  suited  to
     receive  computer  mail.    When you send mail, the mail software
     expects to be able  to  open  a  connection  to  the  addressee's
     computer, in order to send the mail.  If this is a microcomputer,
     it may be turned off, or it may be running an  application  other
     than  the mail system.  For this reason, mail is normally handled
     by a larger system, where it is practical to have a  mail  server
     running all the time.  Microcomputer mail software then becomes a
                                  2
 


     user interface that retrieves mail from the mail  server.    (See
     RFC  821  and  822 for specifications for computer mail.  See RFC
     937 for a protocol designed for microcomputers to use in  reading
     mail from a mail server.)

These  services  should  be  present  in any implementation of TCP/IP,
except that micro-oriented implementations may  not  support  computer
mail.  These traditional applications still play a very important role
in TCP/IP-based networks.  However more recently,  the  way  in  which
networks  are  used has been changing.  The older model of a number of
large, self-sufficient computers is beginning to  change.    Now  many
installations    have    several   kinds   of   computers,   including
microcomputers, workstations, minicomputers, and  mainframes.    These
computers  are  likely  to be configured to perform specialized tasks.
Although people are still likely to work with one  specific  computer,
that  computer  will  call on other systems on the net for specialized
services.  This has  led  to  the  "server/client"  model  of  network
services.    A server is a system that provides a specific service for
the rest of the network.  A client is another system  that  uses  that
service.    (Note  that the server and client need not be on different
computers.  They could be  different  programs  running  on  the  same
computer.)    Here  are  the  kinds  of servers typically present in a
modern computer setup.  Note that these computer services can  all  be
provided within the framework of TCP/IP.

   - network  file  systems.   This allows a system to access files on
     another computer in a somewhat more  closely  integrated  fashion
     than FTP.  A network file system provides the illusion that disks
     or other devices from one system are directly connected to  other
     systems.    There  is no need to use a special network utility to
     access a file on another system.  Your computer simply thinks  it
     has  some  extra disk drives.  These extra "virtual" drives refer
     to the other system's disks.    This  capability  is  useful  for
     several different purposes.  It lets you put large disks on a few
     computers, but still give others access to the disk space.  Aside
     from the obvious economic benefits, this allows people working on
     several computers  to  share  common  files.    It  makes  system
     maintenance  and  backup  easier, because you don't have to worry
     about updating  and  backing  up  copies  on  lots  of  different
     machines.    A  number  of  vendors  now  offer  high-performance
     diskless computers.  These computers have no disk drives at  all.
     They  are  entirely dependent upon disks attached to common "file
     servers".   (See  RFC's  1001  and  1002  for  a  description  of
     PC-oriented   NetBIOS   over   TCP.     In  the  workstation  and
     minicomputer area, Sun's Network File System is more likely to be
     used.    Protocol  specifications  for  it are available from Sun
     Microsystems.)

   - remote printing.  This allows you to  access  printers  on  other
     computers  as if they were directly attached to yours.  (The most
     commonly used protocol is the remote  lineprinter  protocol  from
     Berkeley  Unix.  Unfortunately, there is no protocol document for
     this.  However the C code is easily obtained  from  Berkeley,  so
     implementations are common.)

                                  3
 


   - remote  execution.   This allows you to request that a particular
     program be run on a different computer.  This is useful when  you
     can  do  most  of  your work on a small computer, but a few tasks
     require the resources of a larger system.  There are a number  of
     different  kinds  of remote execution.  Some operate on a command
     by command basis.  That is, you request that a  specific  command
     or  set  of commands should run on some specific computer.  (More
     sophisticated versions will choose a system that  happens  to  be
     free.)    However  there are also "remote procedure call" systems
     that allow a program to  call  a  subroutine  that  will  run  on
     another  computer.    (There  are  many  protocols  of this sort.
     Berkeley Unix contains two servers to execute commands  remotely:
     rsh  and  rexec.   The man pages describe the protocols that they
     use.  The user-contributed software with Berkeley 4.3 contains  a
     "distributed  shell"  that  will  distribute tasks among a set of
     systems, depending upon load.  Remote procedure  call  mechanisms
     have  been  a  topic  for research for a number of years, so many
     organizations have implementations of such facilities.  The  most
     widespread commercially-supported remote procedure call protocols
     seem to be Xerox's Courier and Sun's RPC.  Protocol documents are
     available  from  Xerox and Sun.  There is a public implementation
     of Courier over TCP as part of the user-contributed software with
     Berkeley  4.3.   An implementation of RPC was posted to Usenet by
     Sun, and also appears as part of  the  user-contributed  software
     with Berkeley 4.3.)

   - name  servers.    In  large  installations, there are a number of
     different collections of names that have to  be  managed.    This
     includes  users  and their passwords, names and network addresses
     for computers, and accounts.  It becomes  very  tedious  to  keep
     this data up to date on all of the computers.  Thus the databases
     are kept on a small number of systems.  Other systems access  the
     data over the network.  (RFC 822 and 823 describe the name server
     protocol used to keep track of host names and Internet  addresses
     on  the  Internet.    This  is  now a required part of any TCP/IP
     implementation.  IEN 116 describes an older name server  protocol
     that is used by a few terminal servers and other products to look
     up host names.  Sun's  Yellow  Pages  system  is  designed  as  a
     general  mechanism to handle user names, file sharing groups, and
     other databases commonly used by Unix  systems.    It  is  widely
     available  commercially.    Its  protocol definition is available
     from Sun.)

   - terminal servers.  Many installations no longer connect terminals
     directly  to  computers.    Instead they connect them to terminal
     servers.  A terminal server is simply a small computer that  only
     knows  how  to  run  telnet  (or some other protocol to do remote
     login).  If your terminal is  connected  to  one  of  these,  you
     simply  type the name of a computer, and you are connected to it.
     Generally it is possible to have active connections to more  than
     one  computer  at  the  same time.  The terminal server will have
     provisions to switch between connections rapidly, and  to  notify
     you  when  output  is  waiting for another connection.  (Terminal
     servers use the telnet protocol, already mentioned.  However  any
     real terminal server will also have to support name service and a
                                  4
 


     number of other protocols.)

   - network-oriented  window  systems.      Until   recently,   high-
     performance  graphics  programs had to execute on a computer that
     had  a  bit-mapped  graphics  screen  directly  attached  to  it.
     Network  window  systems  allow  a  program to use a display on a
     different computer.  Full-scale network window systems provide an
     interface  that  lets you distribute jobs to the systems that are
     best  suited  to  handle  them,  but  still  give  you  a  single
     graphically-based  user  interface.  (The most widely-implemented
     window system is X. A  protocol  description  is  available  from
     MIT's  Project  Athena.  A reference implementation is publically
     available from MIT.  A number  of  vendors  are  also  supporting
     NeWS,  a window system defined by Sun.  Both of these systems are
     designed to use TCP/IP.)

Note that some of the  protocols  described  above  were  designed  by
Berkeley,  Sun,  or other organizations.  Thus they are not officially
part of the Internet protocol suite.   However  they  are  implemented
using  TCP/IP, just as normal TCP/IP application protocols are.  Since
the protocol definitions are not  considered  proprietary,  and  since
commercially-support  implementations  are  widely  available,  it  is
reasonable to think of these protocols as being  effectively  part  of
the  Internet  suite.   Note that the list above is simply a sample of
the sort of services  available  through  TCP/IP.    However  it  does
contain   the  majority  of  the  "major"  applications.    The  other
commonly-used protocols tend to be specialized facilities for  getting
information  of  various  kinds, such as who is logged in, the time of
day, etc.  However if you need a facility that is not listed here,  we
encourage  you  to  look  through  the  current  edition  of  Internet
Protocols (currently RFC 1011),  which  lists  all  of  the  available
protocols,   and   also   to   look   at  some  of  the  major  TCP/IP
implementations to see what various vendors have added.



2. General description of the TCP/IP protocols


TCP/IP is a layered set of protocols.  In  order  to  understand  what
this  means,  it is useful to look at an example.  A typical situation
is sending mail.  First, there is a protocol for mail.  This defines a
set  of  commands which one machine sends to another, e.g. commands to
specify who the sender of the message is, who it is being sent to, and
then  the  text  of  the  message.  However this protocol assumes that
there is a way to communicate  reliably  between  the  two  computers.
Mail,  like  other  application  protocols,  simply  defines  a set of
commands and messages to be sent.  It is designed to be used  together
with  TCP and IP. TCP is responsible for making sure that the commands
get through to the other end.  It keeps track of  what  is  sent,  and
retransmitts anything that did not get through.  If any message is too
large for one datagram, e.g. the text of the mail, TCP will  split  it
up  into  several  datagrams,  and  make  sure  that  they  all arrive
correctly.  Since these functions are needed  for  many  applications,
they are put together into a separate protocol, rather than being part
                                  5
 


of the specifications for sending mail.   You  can  think  of  TCP  as
forming a library of routines that applications can use when they need
reliable network communications with another computer.  Similarly, TCP
calls  on the services of IP.  Although the services that TCP supplies
are needed by  many  applications,  there  are  still  some  kinds  of
applications  that  don't  need them.  However there are some services
that every application needs.  So these services are put together into
IP.    As  with TCP, you can think of IP as a library of routines that
TCP calls on, but which is also available to applications  that  don't
use  TCP.    This  strategy  of building several levels of protocol is
called "layering".  We think of  the  applications  programs  such  as
mail,  TCP, and IP, as being separate "layers", each of which calls on
the services of the layer below it.   Generally,  TCP/IP  applications
use 4 layers:

   - an application protocol such as mail

   - a  protocol  such  as  TCP  that  provides  services need by many
     applications

   - IP, which provides the basic  service  of  getting  datagrams  to
     their destination

   - the  protocols  needed to manage a specific physical medium, such
     as Ethernet or a point to point line.

TCP/IP is based on the "catenet model".  (This is  described  in  more
detail  in  IEN 48.)  This model assumes that there are a large number
of independent networks connected together  by  gateways.    The  user
should  be able to access computers or other resources on any of these
networks.   Datagrams  will  often  pass  through  a  dozen  different
networks  before  getting  to  their  final  destination.  The routing
needed to accomplish this should be completely invisible to the  user.
As  far  as  the  user  is concerned, all he needs to know in order to
access another system is an "Internet address".  This  is  an  address
that looks like 128.6.4.194.  It is actually a 32-bit number.  However
it is normally written as 4 decimal numbers, each representing 8  bits
of  the  address.  (The term "octet" is used by Internet documentation
for such 8-bit chunks.  The term "byte" is not used, because TCP/IP is
supported  by  some computers that have byte sizes other than 8 bits.)
Generally the structure of the  address  gives  you  some  information
about  how  to  get  to  the  system.  For example, 128.6 is a network
number assigned by a central authority to Rutgers University.  Rutgers
uses  the  next  octet  to  indicate  which of the campus Ethernets is
involved.  128.6.4 happens to be an  Ethernet  used  by  the  Computer
Science  Department.    The last octet allows for up to 254 systems on
each Ethernet.  (It is 254 because 0 and  255  are  not  allowed,  for
reasons  that  will  be  discussed  later.)  Note that 128.6.4.194 and
128.6.5.194 would be different systems.  The structure of an  Internet
address is described in a bit more detail later.

Of  course  we  normally  refer  to  systems  by  name, rather than by
Internet address.  When we specify a name, the network software  looks
it  up  in  a  database,  and comes up with the corresponding Internet
address.  Most of the network software deals strictly in terms of  the
                                  6
 


address.  (RFC 882 describes the name server technology used to handle
this lookup.)

TCP/IP is  built  on  "connectionless"  technology.    Information  is
transfered  as  a sequence of "datagrams".  A datagram is a collection
of data that is sent as a single message.  Each of these datagrams  is
sent  through  the network individually.  There are provisions to open
connections (i.e.  to start a conversation that will continue for some
time).    However at some level, information from those connections is
broken up into datagrams, and  those  datagrams  are  treated  by  the
network  as  completely  separate.    For example, suppose you want to
transfer a 15000 octet file.  Most networks can't handle a 15000 octet
datagram.   So the protocols will break this up into something like 30
500-octet datagrams.  Each of these datagrams  will  be  sent  to  the
other  end.    At  that point, they will be put back together into the
15000-octet file.  However while those datagrams are in  transit,  the
network doesn't know that there is any connection between them.  It is
perfectly possible  that  datagram  14  will  actually  arrive  before
datagram  13.    It is also possible that somewhere in the network, an
error will occur, and some datagram won't get through at all.  In that
case, that datagram has to be sent again.

Note  by  the way that the terms "datagram" and "packet" often seem to
be nearly interchangable.  Technically, datagram is the right word  to
use  when  describing  TCP/IP.  A datagram is a unit of data, which is
what the protocols deal with.  A packet is a physical thing, appearing
on an Ethernet or some wire.  In most cases a packet simply contains a
datagram, so there is  very  little  difference.    However  they  can
differ.  When TCP/IP is used on top of X.25, the X.25 interface breaks
the datagrams up into 128-byte packets.   This  is  invisible  to  IP,
because  the  packets  are put back together into a single datagram at
the other end before being processed by TCP/IP.  So in this case,  one
IP  datagram  would  be carried by several packets.  However with most
media, there are efficiency advantages to  sending  one  datagram  per
packet, and so the distinction tends to vanish.



2.1 The TCP level


Two separate protocols are involved in handling TCP/IP datagrams.  TCP
(the "transmission control protocol") is responsible for  breaking  up
the  message  into  datagrams,  reassembling  them  at  the other end,
resending anything that gets lost, and  putting  things  back  in  the
right  order.  IP (the "internet protocol") is responsible for routing
individual datagrams.  It may seem like TCP is  doing  all  the  work.
And  in  small networks that is true.  However in the Internet, simply
getting a datagram to its  destination  can  be  a  complex  job.    A
connection  may require the datagram to go through several networks at
Rutgers, a serial line to the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center,  a
couple  of Ethernets there, a series of 56Kbaud phone lines to another
NSFnet site, and more Ethernets on another campus.  Keeping  track  of
the  routes  to all of the destinations and handling incompatibilities
among different transport media turns out to be a complex job.    Note
                                  7
 


that  the  interface  between TCP and IP is fairly simple.  TCP simply
hands IP a datagram with a destination.   IP  doesn't  know  how  this
datagram relates to any datagram before it or after it.

It  may  have occurred to you that something is missing here.  We have
talked about Internet addresses, but not about how you keep  track  of
multiple  connections  to  a given system.  Clearly it isn't enough to
get a datagram to the right  destination.    TCP  has  to  know  which
connection  this  datagram  is  part  of.  This task is referred to as
"demultiplexing."  In fact, there are several levels of demultiplexing
going  on in TCP/IP.  The information needed to do this demultiplexing
is contained in a series of "headers".  A header is simply a few extra
octets  tacked  onto  the  beginning of a datagram by some protocol in
order to keep track of it.  It's a lot like putting a letter  into  an
envelope  and  putting  an  address  on  the  outside of the envelope.
Except with modern networks it happens several times.  It's  like  you
put the letter into a little envelope, your secretary puts that into a
somewhat bigger envelope, the campus mail center  puts  that  envelope
into a still bigger one, etc.  Here is an overview of the headers that
get stuck on a message that passes through a typical TCP/IP network:

We start with a single data stream, say a file you are trying to  send
to some other computer:

   ......................................................

TCP  breaks  it  up into manageable chunks.  (In order to do this, TCP
has to know how large a datagram your network can handle.    Actually,
the TCP's at each end say how big a datagram they can handle, and then
they pick the smallest size.)

   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....

TCP puts a header at the front of each datagram.  This header actually
contains  at least 20 octets, but the most important ones are a source
and destination "port number" and  a  "sequence  number".    The  port
numbers  are used to keep track of different conversations.  Suppose 3
different people are transferring files.  Your TCP might allocate port
numbers 1000, 1001, and 1002 to these transfers.  When you are sending
a datagram, this becomes the "source" port number, since you  are  the
source  of  the  datagram.    Of  course  the TCP at the other end has
assigned a port number of its own for the conversation.  Your TCP  has
to  know the port number used by the other end as well.  (It finds out
when the connection starts, as we will explain below.)  It  puts  this
in  the  "destination" port field.  Of course if the other end sends a
datagram back to you, the source and destination port numbers will  be
reversed,  since  then  it  will  be  the  source  and you will be the
destination.  Each datagram has a sequence number.  This  is  used  so
that  the  other  end  can make sure that it gets the datagrams in the
right  order,  and  that  it  hasn't  missed  any.    (See   the   TCP
specification for details.)  TCP doesn't number the datagrams, but the
octets.  So if there are 500 octets of  data  in  each  datagram,  the
first datagram might be numbered 0, the second 500, the next 1000, the
next 1500, etc.  Finally, I will mention the  Checksum.    This  is  a
number  that  is  computed by adding up all the octets in the datagram
                                  8
 


(more or less - see the TCP spec).  The result is put in  the  header.
TCP  at  the other end computes the checksum again.  If they disagree,
then something bad happened to the datagram in transmission, and it is
thrown away.  So here's what the datagram looks like now.

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |          Source Port          |       Destination Port        |

    |   ......                                                      |

If  we abbreviate the TCP header as "T", the whole file now looks like
this:

   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....

You will note that there are items in  the  header  that  I  have  not
described  above.    They  are  generally  involved  with managing the
connection.  In order to make sure the datagram  has  arrived  at  its
destination,  the  recipient  has  to  send back an "acknowledgement".
This is a datagram whose "Acknowledgement number" field is filled  in.
For  example,  sending  a  packet  with  an  acknowledgement  of  1500
indicates that you have received all the data up to octet number 1500.
If  the  sender  doesn't  get  an  acknowledgement within a reasonable
amount of time, it sends the data  again.    The  window  is  used  to
control  how  much  data can be in transit at any one time.  It is not
practical to wait for each datagram to be acknowledged before  sending
the  next  one.    That would slow things down too much.  On the other
hand, you can't just keep sending, or a fast  computer  might  overrun
the  capacity  of  a slow one to absorb data.  Thus each end indicates
how much new data it is currently prepared to absorb  by  putting  the
number  of  octets  in  its  "Window" field.  As the computer receives
data, the amount of space left in its window decreases.  When it  goes
to  zero, the sender has to stop.  As the receiver processes the data,
it increases its window, indicating that it is ready  to  accept  more
data.  Often the same datagram can be used to acknowledge receipt of a
set of data and to give permission for  additional  new  data  (by  an
updated  window).  The "Urgent" field allows one end to tell the other
to skip ahead in its processing to a particular octet.  This is  often
useful  for  handling asynchronous events, for example when you type a
control character or other command that interrupts output.  The  other
fields are beyond the scope of this document.

2.2 The IP level


TCP  sends each of these datagrams to IP.  Of course it has to tell IP
the Internet address of the computer at the other end.  Note that this
is  all  IP  is concerned about.  It doesn't care about what is in the
datagram, or even in the TCP header.  IP's job is  simply  to  find  a
route for the datagram and get it to the other end.  In order to allow
gateways or other intermediate systems to  forward  the  datagram,  it
adds  its  own  header.  The main things in this header are the source
and destination Internet address (32-bit addresses, like 128.6.4.194),
the  protocol  number,  and  another  checksum.    The source Internet
address is simply the address of your machine.  (This is necessary  so
the  other  end  knows where the datagram came from.)  The destination
Internet address is the address  of  the  other  machine.    (This  is
necessary  so  any  gateways  in  the  middle  know where you want the
datagram to go.)  The protocol number tells IP at  the  other  end  to
send  the  datagram  to TCP.  Although most IP traffic uses TCP, there
are other protocols that can use IP, so you  have  to  tell  IP  which
protocol  to send the datagram to.  Finally, the checksum allows IP at
the other end to verify that the header  wasn't  damaged  in  transit.
Note  that TCP and IP have separate checksums.  IP needs to be able to
verify that the header didn't get damaged in transit, or it could send
a  message to the wrong place.  For reasons not worth discussing here,
it is both more efficient and safer to have  TCP  compute  a  separate
checksum  for  the  TCP  header  and  data.  Once IP has tacked on its
header, here's what the message looks like:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                       Source Address                          |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                    Destination Address                        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  TCP header, then your data ......                            |
    |                                                               |

If we represent the IP header by an "I",  your  file  now  looks  like
this:

   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....

Again,  the  header contains some additional fields that have not been
discussed.  Most of them are beyond the scope of this document.    The
flags  and fragment offset are used to keep track of the pieces when a
datagram has to be split up.   This  can  happen  when  datagrams  are
forwarded through a network for which they are too big.  (This will be
discussed a bit more below.)  The time to live is  a  number  that  is
decremented  whenever  the  datagram passes through a system.  When it
goes to zero, the datagram is discarded.  This is done in case a  loop
                                  10
 


develops  in the system somehow.  Of course this should be impossible,
but  well-designed  networks  are  built  to  cope  with  "impossible"
conditions.

At this point, it's possible that no more headers are needed.  If your
computer happens to have a direct phone  line  connecting  it  to  the
destination  computer,  or  to  a  gateway,  it  may  simply  send the
datagrams out on the line (though likely a synchronous  protocol  such
as  HDLC  would be used, and it would add at least a few octets at the
beginning and end).



2.3 The Ethernet level


However most of our networks these days use Ethernet.  So now we  have
to  describe  Ethernet's headers.  Unfortunately, Ethernet has its own
addresses.  The people who designed Ethernet wanted to make sure  that
no  two  machines  would  end  up  with  the  same  Ethernet  address.
Furthermore, they  didn't  want  the  user  to  have  to  worry  about
assigning  addresses.    So  each  Ethernet  controller  comes with an
address builtin from the factory.  In order to  make  sure  that  they
would  never have to reuse addresses, the Ethernet designers allocated
48 bits for the Ethernet address.  People who make Ethernet  equipment
have  to  register  with  a  central  authority, to make sure that the
numbers they assign don't overlap any other manufacturer.  Ethernet is
a "broadcast medium".  That is, it is in effect like an old party line
telephone.  When you send a packet out on the Ethernet, every  machine
on  the  network sees the packet.  So something is needed to make sure
that the right machine gets it.  As you might guess, this involves the
Ethernet  header.    Every  Ethernet packet has a 14-octet header that
includes the source and destination Ethernet address, and a type code.
Each machine is supposed to pay attention only to packets with its own
Ethernet address in the destination field.  (It's  perfectly  possible
to  cheat,  which  is  one reason that Ethernet communications are not
terribly secure.)  Note  that  there  is  no  connection  between  the
Ethernet address and the Internet address.  Each machine has to have a
table of what Ethernet address corresponds to what  Internet  address.
(We  will  describe  how  this  table is constructed a bit later.)  In
addition to the addresses, the header contains a type code.  The  type
code is to allow for several different protocol families to be used on
the same network.  So you can use TCP/IP, DECnet, Xerox  NS,  etc.  at
the  same  time.   Each of them will put a different value in the type
field.  Finally,  there  is  a  checksum.    The  Ethernet  controller
computes a checksum of the entire packet.  When the other end receives
the packet, it recomputes the checksum, and throws the packet away  if
the  answer  disagrees  with the original.  The checksum is put on the
end of the packet, not in the header.  The final result is  that  your
message looks like this:





                                  11
 


    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       Ethernet destination address (first 32 bits)            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Ethernet dest (last 16 bits)  |Ethernet source (first 16 bits)|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       Ethernet source address (last 32 bits)                  |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |        Type code              |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  IP header, then TCP header, then your data                   |
    |                                                               |
        ...
    |                                                               |
    |   end of your data                                            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                       Ethernet Checksum                       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

If  we  represent  the  Ethernet  header  with  "E",  and the Ethernet
checksum with "C", your file now looks like this:

   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C

When these packets are received by the other end, of  course  all  the
headers  are  removed.    The  Ethernet interface removes the Ethernet
header and the checksum.  It looks at the type code.  Since  the  type
code  is the one assigned to IP, the Ethernet device driver passes the
datagram up to IP.  IP removes the IP header.   It  looks  at  the  IP
protocol  field.    Since  the  protocol  type  is  TCP, it passes the
datagram up to TCP.  TCP now looks at the sequence number.    It  uses
the  sequence  numbers  and  other  information  to  combine  all  the
datagrams into the original file.

The ends our initial summary of TCP/IP.  There are still some  crucial
concepts we haven't gotten to, so we'll now go back and add details in
several areas.  (For detailed descriptions of the items discussed here
see,  RFC  793  for  TCP,  RFC  791  for IP, and RFC's 894 and 826 for
sending IP over Ethernet.)



3. Well-known sockets and the applications layer


So far, we have described how a stream  of  data  is  broken  up  into
datagrams,  sent  to another computer, and put back together.  However
something more is needed  in  order  to  accomplish  anything  useful.
There  has  to  be  a  way for you to open a connection to a specified
computer, log into it, tell it what file you  want,  and  control  the
transmission  of  the  file.   (If you have a different application in
mind, e.g. computer mail, some analogous protocol is needed.)  This is
done  by  "application  protocols".  The application protocols run "on
top" of TCP/IP.  That is, when they want to send a message, they  give
the  message  to  TCP.   TCP makes sure it gets delivered to the other
end.  Because TCP and IP take care of all the networking details,  the
                                  12
 


applications  protocols can treat a network connection as if it were a
simple byte stream, like a terminal or phone line.

Before going into more details about applications programs, we have to
describe how you find an application.  Suppose you want to send a file
to a computer whose Internet address  is  128.6.4.7.    To  start  the
process,  you  need  more than just the Internet address.  You have to
connect to the FTP server at the  other  end.    In  general,  network
programs  are  specialized  for a specific set of tasks.  Most systems
have separate programs  to  handle  file  transfers,  remote  terminal
logins, mail, etc.  When you connect to 128.6.4.7, you have to specify
that you want to talk to the FTP server.    This  is  done  by  having
"well-known  sockets"  for  each  server.    Recall that TCP uses port
numbers to keep track of  individual  conversations.    User  programs
normally  use more or less random port numbers.  However specific port
numbers are assigned to the programs that sit  waiting  for  requests.
For  example,  if  you  want  to send a file, you will start a program
called "ftp".  It will open a connection using some random number, say
1234,  for  the  port number on its end.  However it will specify port
number 21 for the other end.  This is the official port number for the
FTP server.  Note that there are two different programs involved.  You
run ftp on your side.  This is a program designed to  accept  commands
from  your  terminal  and  pass them on to the other end.  The program
that you talk to on the other machine  is  the  FTP  server.    It  is
designed  to  accept commands from the network connection, rather than
an interactive terminal.  There is no need for your program to  use  a
well-known  socket  number  for  itself.  Nobody is trying to find it.
However the servers have to have well-known numbers,  so  that  people
can  open  connections  to  them and start sending them commands.  The
official  port  numbers  for  each  program  are  given  in  "Assigned
Numbers".

Note  that  a  connection is actually described by a set of 4 numbers:
the Internet address at each end, and the TCP port number at each end.
Every  datagram  has  all  four of those numbers in it.  (The Internet
addresses are in the IP header, and the TCP port numbers  are  in  the
TCP header.)  In order to keep things straight, no two connections can
have the same set of numbers.  However it is enough for any one number
to  be  different.    For  example,  it  is perfectly possible for two
different users on a machine to be sending files  to  the  same  other
machine.    This  could  result  in  connections  with  the  following
parameters:

                   Internet addresses         TCP ports
    connection 1  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1234, 21
    connection 2  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1235, 21

Since the same machines are involved, the Internet addresses  are  the
same.    Since  they  are  both  doing  file transfers, one end of the
connection involves the well-known port number  for  FTP.    The  only
thing  that  differs is the port number for the program that the users
are running.  That's enough of a difference.  Generally, at least  one
end  of  the  connection asks the network software to assign it a port
number that is guaranteed to be unique.   Normally,  it's  the  user's
end, since the server has to use a well-known number.
                                  13
 


Now  that  we  know  how  to  open  connections, let's get back to the
applications programs.  As mentioned earlier, once TCP  has  opened  a
connection,  we  have  something  that might as well be a simple wire.
All the hard parts are handled by TCP and IP.  However we  still  need
some  agreement  as  to  what we send over this connection.  In effect
this is simply an agreement on what set of  commands  the  application
will  understand,  and  the  format  in  which  they  are  to be sent.
Generally, what is sent is a combination of commands and data.    They
use  context  to  differentiate.  For example, the mail protocol works
like this: Your mail program opens a connection to the mail server  at
the  other end.  Your program gives it your machine's name, the sender
of the message, and the recipients you want it sent to.  It then sends
a  command saying that it is starting the message.  At that point, the
other end  stops  treating  what  it  sees  as  commands,  and  starts
accepting  the  message.  Your end then starts sending the text of the
message.  At the end of the message, a special mark is sent (a dot  in
the first column).  After that, both ends understand that your program
is again sending commands.  This is the simplest way to do things, and
the one that most applications use.

File  transfer  is  somewhat more complex.  The file transfer protocol
involves two different connections.  It starts  out  just  like  mail.
The user's program sends commands like "log me in as this user", "here
is my password", "send me the file with this name".  However once  the
command  to  send  data is sent, a second connection is opened for the
data itself.  It would certainly be possible to send the data  on  the
same  connection,  as  mail does.  However file transfers often take a
long time.  The designers of the  file  transfer  protocol  wanted  to
allow  the  user  to  continue  issuing commands while the transfer is
going on.  For example, the user might make an inquiry,  or  he  might
abort  the  transfer.    Thus  the designers felt it was best to use a
separate connection for  the  data  and  leave  the  original  command
connection  for  commands.    (It  is  also  possible  to open command
connections to two different computers, and tell them to send  a  file
from  one  to  the other.  In that case, the data couldn't go over the
command connection.)

Remote terminal connections use another mechanism still.   For  remote
logins,  there  is just one connection.  It normally sends data.  When
it is necessary to send a command (e.g. to set the terminal type or to
change  some  mode),  a special character is used to indicate that the
next character is a command.  If the user happens to type that special
character as data, two of them are sent.

We  are  not  going to describe the application protocols in detail in
this document.  It's better to read the RFC's yourself.  However there
are  a  couple of common conventions used by applications that will be
described here.  First, the common network representation:  TCP/IP  is
intended  to  be  usable  on  any  computer.    Unfortunately, not all
computers agree on how data is represented.  There are differences  in
character  codes  (ASCII  vs.  EBCDIC),  in  end  of  line conventions
(carriage return, line feed, or a representation using counts), and in
whether  terminals expect characters to be sent individually or a line
at a time.   In  order  to  allow  computers  of  different  kinds  to
communicate,   each   applications   protocol   defines   a   standard
                                  14
 


representation.    Note  that  TCP  and  IP  do  not  care  about  the
representation.    TCP  simply  sends octets.  However the programs at
both ends have to agree on how the octets are to be interpreted.   The
RFC  for  each  application  specifies the standard representation for
that application.  Normally it  is  "net  ASCII".    This  uses  ASCII
characters,  with end of line denoted by a carriage return followed by
a line feed.  For remote login,  there  is  also  a  definition  of  a
"standard terminal", which turns out to be a half-duplex terminal with
echoing happening on the local machine.  Most applications  also  make
provisions  for  the  two  computers to agree on other representations
that they may find more convenient.  For example, PDP-10's have 36-bit
words.    There  is a way that two PDP-10's can agree to send a 36-bit
binary file.  Similarly, two systems that prefer full-duplex  terminal
conversations  can  agree  on  that.    However each application has a
standard representation, which every machine must support.



3.1 An example application: SMTP


In order to give a bit better idea what is involved in the application
protocols,  I'm  going  to  show an example of SMTP, which is the mail
protocol.  (SMTP is "simple mail transfer protocol.)  We assume that a
computer called TOPAZ.RUTGERS.EDU wants to send the following message.

  Date: Sat, 27 Jun 87 13:26:31 EDT
  From: hedrick@topaz.rutgers.edu
  To: levy@red.rutgers.edu
  Subject: meeting

  Let's get together Monday at 1pm.

First,  note  that the format of the message itself is described by an
Internet standard (RFC 822).  The standard specifies the fact that the
message  must be transmitted as net ASCII (i.e. it must be ASCII, with
carriage return/linefeed to delimit lines).   It  also  describes  the
general  structure, as a group of header lines, then a blank line, and
then the body of the message.  Finally, it describes the syntax of the
header  lines in detail.  Generally they consist of a keyword and then
a value.

Note  that  the  addressee  is  indicated   as   LEVY@RED.RUTGERS.EDU.
Initially,  addresses were simply "person at machine".  However recent
standards have made things more flexible.  There  are  now  provisions
for  systems  to handle other systems' mail.  This can allow automatic
forwarding on behalf of computers not connected to the Internet.    It
can be used to direct mail for a number of systems to one central mail
server.  Indeed there is no requirement that an actual computer by the
name  of RED.RUTGERS.EDU even exist.  The name servers could be set up
so that you mail to department names, and each  department's  mail  is
routed  automatically to an appropriate computer.  It is also possible
that the part before the @ is something other than a user name.  It is
possible  for  programs  to be set up to process mail.  There are also
provisions  to  handle  mailing  lists,  and  generic  names  such  as
                                  15
 


"postmaster" or "operator".

The  way  the  message is to be sent to another system is described by
RFC's 821 and 974.  The program that is going to be doing the  sending
asks  the  name server several queries to determine where to route the
message.  The first query is to find out which  machines  handle  mail
for  the  name RED.RUTGERS.EDU.  In this case, the server replies that
RED.RUTGERS.EDU handles its own mail.  The program then asks  for  the
address of RED.RUTGERS.EDU, which is 128.6.4.2.  Then the mail program
opens a TCP connection to port 25  on  128.6.4.2.    Port  25  is  the
well-known  socket  used  for receiving mail.  Once this connection is
established, the mail program starts sending  commands.    Here  is  a
typical  conversation.  Each line is labelled as to whether it is from
TOPAZ or RED.  Note that TOPAZ initiated the connection:

    RED    220 RED.RUTGERS.EDU SMTP Service at 29 Jun 87 05:17:18 EDT

First, note that commands all use normal text.  This is typical of the
Internet  standards.    Many  of  the  protocols  use  standard  ASCII
commands.  This makes it easy  to  watch  what  is  going  on  and  to
diagnose  problems.  For example, the mail program keeps a log of each
conversation.  If something goes wrong, the log  file  can  simply  be
mailed  to  the  postmaster.  Since it is normal text, he can see what
was going on.  It also allows a human to interact  directly  with  the
mail  server,  for  testing.  (Some newer protocols are complex enough
that this is not practical.  The commands would have to have a  syntax
that would require a significant parser.  Thus there is a tendency for
newer protocols to use binary formats.  Generally they are  structured
like  C or Pascal record structures.)  Second, note that the responses
all begin with numbers.  This is also typical of  Internet  protocols.
The  allowable  responses  are  defined  in the protocol.  The numbers
allow the user program to respond unambiguously.    The  rest  of  the
response  is  text,  which is normally for use by any human who may be
watching or looking at a log.  It has no effect on  the  operation  of
the  programs.  (However there is one point at which the protocol uses
part of the text of the response.)   The  commands  themselves  simply
allow  the  mail  program  on  one  end  to  tell  the mail server the
                                  16
 


information it needs to know in order to deliver the message.  In this
case,  the  mail  server  could  get the information by looking at the
message itself.  But for more complex cases, that would not  be  safe.
Every  session  must  begin  with  a HELO, which gives the name of the
system that initiated the connection.  Then the sender and  recipients
are specified.  (There can be more than one RCPT command, if there are
several recipients.)  Finally the data itself is sent.  Note that  the
text  of the message is terminated by a line containing just a period.
(If such a line appears in the message, the period is doubled.)  After
the  message  is  accepted,  the  sender  can send another message, or
terminate the session as in the example above.

Generally, there is a pattern to the response numbers.   The  protocol
defines  the  specific set of responses that can be sent as answers to
any given command.  However programs that don't want to  analyze  them
in  detail  can  just  look at the first digit.  In general, responses
that begin with a 2  indicate  success.    Those  that  begin  with  3
indicate  that some further action is needed, as shown above.  4 and 5
indicate errors.  4 is a "temporary" error, such as  a  disk  filling.
The  message should be saved, and tried again later.  5 is a permanent
error, such as a  non-existent  recipient.    The  message  should  be
returned to the sender with an error message.

(For  more  details about the protocols mentioned in this section, see
RFC's 821/822 for mail, RFC 959 for file transfer, and  RFC's  854/855
for  remote  logins.  For the well-known port numbers, see the current
edition of Assigned Numbers, and possibly RFC 814.)



4. Protocols other than TCP: UDP and ICMP


So far, we have described only connections that use TCP.  Recall  that
TCP  is  responsible  for  breaking  up  messages  into datagrams, and
reassembling them properly.  However in  many  applications,  we  have
messages  that  will  always  fit in a single datagram.  An example is
name lookup.  When a user attempts to make  a  connection  to  another
system,  he  will  generally  specify  the system by name, rather than
Internet address.  His system has to translate that name to an address
before  it  can  do  anything.  Generally, only a few systems have the
database used to translate names to addresses.  So the  user's  system
will want to send a query to one of the systems that has the database.
This query is going to be very short.  It will certainly  fit  in  one
datagram.    So  will the answer.  Thus it seems silly to use TCP.  Of
course TCP does more than just break things up  into  datagrams.    It
also  makes  sure  that  the  data  arrives, resending datagrams where
necessary.  But for a question that fits  in  a  single  datagram,  we
don't  need  all the complexity of TCP to do this.  If we don't get an
answer after a few seconds, we can just ask again.   For  applications
like this, there are alternatives to TCP.

The most common alternative is UDP ("user datagram protocol").  UDP is
designed for applications where you don't need  to  put  sequences  of
datagrams  together.  It fits into the system much like TCP.  There is
                                  17
 


a UDP header.  The network software puts the UDP header on  the  front
of  your  data, just as it would put a TCP header on the front of your
data.  Then UDP sends the data  to  IP,  which  adds  the  IP  header,
putting  UDP's  protocol number in the protocol field instead of TCP's
protocol number.  However UDP doesn't do as much  as  TCP  does.    It
doesn't  split data into multiple datagrams.  It doesn't keep track of
what it has sent so it can resend if necessary.  About  all  that  UDP
provides  is  port  numbers,  so  that several programs can use UDP at
once.  UDP port numbers are used just like TCP port  numbers.    There
are  well-known  port numbers for servers that use UDP.  Note that the
UDP header is shorter than a TCP header.   It  still  has  source  and
destination  port  numbers,  and  a checksum, but that's about it.  No
sequence number, since it is not needed.  UDP is used by the protocols
that  handle  name  lookups (see IEN 116, RFC 882, and RFC 883), and a
number of similar protocols.

Another  alternative  protocol  is  ICMP  ("Internet  control  message
protocol").    ICMP  is  used  for  error messages, and other messages
intended for the TCP/IP software itself, rather  than  any  particular
user  program.  For example, if you attempt to connect to a host, your
system may get back an ICMP message saying "host unreachable".    ICMP
can  also be used to find out some information about the network.  See
RFC 792 for details of ICMP.  ICMP is  similar  to  UDP,  in  that  it
handles messages that fit in one datagram.  However it is even simpler
than UDP.  It doesn't even have port numbers in its header.  Since all
ICMP  messages are interpreted by the network software itself, no port
numbers are needed to say where a ICMP message is supposed to go.



5. Keeping track of names and information: the domain system


As we indicated earlier, the network software generally needs a 32-bit
Internet  address  in  order  to open a connection or send a datagram.
However users prefer to deal with computer names rather than  numbers.
Thus  there  is  a database that allows the software to look up a name
and find the corresponding number.  When the Internet was small,  this
was  easy.  Each system would have a file that listed all of the other
systems, giving both their name and number.  There are  now  too  many
computers  for  this  approach to be practical.  Thus these files have
been replaced by a set of name servers that keep track of  host  names
and  the corresponding Internet addresses.  (In fact these servers are
somewhat more general than that.  This is just one kind of information
stored in the domain system.)  Note that a set of interlocking servers
are used, rather than a single central one.  There  are  now  so  many
different  institutions  connected  to  the  Internet that it would be
impractical for them to  notify  a  central  authority  whenever  they
installed  or moved a computer.  Thus naming authority is delegated to
individual institutions.  The name servers form a tree,  corresponding
to  institutional  structure.    The names themselves follow a similar
structure.  A typical example is the name BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  This  is
a  computer  at  the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) at MIT.  In
order to find its Internet address,  you  might  potentially  have  to
consult  4  different  servers.  First, you would ask a central server
                                  18
 


(called the root) where the EDU server is.  EDU is a server that keeps
track of educational institutions.  The root server would give you the
names and Internet addresses of several servers for EDU.   (There  are
several  servers  at  each  level,  to allow for the possibly that one
might be down.)  You would then ask EDU where the server for  MIT  is.
Again,  it  would  give  you  names  and Internet addresses of several
servers for MIT.  Generally, not all of those servers would be at MIT,
to  allow for the possibility of a general power failure at MIT.  Then
you would ask MIT where the server for LCS is, and finally  you  would
ask one of the LCS servers about BORAX.  The final result would be the
Internet address for BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.    Each  of  these  levels  is
referred  to  as  a  "domain".  The entire name, BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU, is
called a "domain name".    (So  are  the  names  of  the  higher-level
domains, such as LCS.MIT.EDU, MIT.EDU, and EDU.)

Fortunately,  you  don't really have to go through all of this most of
the time.  First of all, the root name servers also happen to  be  the
name  servers  for  the  top-level domains such as EDU.  Thus a single
query to a root  server  will  get  you  to  MIT.    Second,  software
generally  remembers answers that it got before.  So once we look up a
name at LCS.MIT.EDU, our software remembers where to find servers  for
LCS.MIT.EDU,  MIT.EDU,  and EDU.  It also remembers the translation of
BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Each of these pieces of information has a "time to
live"  associated with it.  Typically this is a few days.  After that,
the information expires and has to be looked up again.    This  allows
institutions to change things.

The  domain  system  is not limited to finding out Internet addresses.
Each domain name is a node in a database.  The node can  have  records
that  define  a number of different properties.  Examples are Internet
address, computer type, and a list of services provided by a computer.
A  program  can  ask  for  a  specific  piece  of  information, or all
information about a given name.  It is possible  for  a  node  in  the
database  to  be  marked as an "alias" (or nickname) for another node.
It is also possible to use the  domain  system  to  store  information
about users, mailing lists, or other objects.

There  is  an  Internet  standard  defining  the  operation  of  these
databases, as well as the protocols used  to  make  queries  of  them.
Every  network utility has to be able to make such queries, since this
is now the official way to evaluate host names.   Generally  utilities
will talk to a server on their own system.  This server will take care
of contacting the other servers for them.  This keeps down the  amount
of code that has to be in each application program.

The  domain  system  is  particularly  important for handling computer
mail.  There are entry types to define what computer handles mail  for
a  given  name, to specify where an individual is to receive mail, and
to define mailing lists.

(See RFC's 882, 883, and 973 for specifications of the domain  system.
RFC 974 defines the use of the domain system in sending mail.)

6. Routing


The   description  above  indicated  that  the  IP  implementation  is
responsible for getting datagrams to the destination indicated by  the
destination address, but little was said about how this would be done.
The task of finding how to  get  a  datagram  to  its  destination  is
referred to as "routing".  In fact many of the details depend upon the
particular implementation.  However some general things can be said.

First, it is necessary to understand the model on which IP  is  based.
IP assumes that a system is attached to some local network.  We assume
that the system can send datagrams to any  other  system  on  its  own
network.    (In  the  case  of  Ethernet, it simply finds the Ethernet
address of the destination system, and puts the datagram  out  on  the
Ethernet.)    The  problem  comes  when  a  system  is asked to send a
datagram to a system on a different network.  This problem is  handled
by  gateways.   A gateway is a system that connects a network with one
or more other networks.  Gateways  are  often  normal  computers  that
happen  to have more than one network interface.  For example, we have
a Unix machine that has two different Ethernet interfaces.  Thus it is
connected  to networks 128.6.4 and 128.6.3.  This machine can act as a
gateway between those two networks.  The software on that machine must
be  set  up  so that it will forward datagrams from one network to the
other.  That is, if a machine on network 128.6.4 sends a  datagram  to
the  gateway,  and  the  datagram is addressed to a machine on network
128.6.3, the gateway will forward the  datagram  to  the  destination.
Major communications centers often have gateways that connect a number
of different  networks.    (In  many  cases,  special-purpose  gateway
systems provide better performance or reliability than general-purpose
systems acting as gateways.  A number of vendors sell such systems.)

Routing in IP is  based  entirely  upon  the  network  number  of  the
destination  address.    Each computer has a table of network numbers.
For each network number, a gateway is listed.  This is the gateway  to
be used to get to that network.  Note that the gateway doesn't have to
connect directly to the network.  It just has to be the best place  to
go  to  get there.  For example at Rutgers, our interface to NSFnet is
at the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center (JvNC). Our connection  to
JvNC  is  via  a  high-speed  serial line connected to a gateway whose
address is 128.6.3.12.  Systems on net 128.6.3 will list 128.6.3.12 as
the  gateway  for  many  off-campus  networks.  However systems on net
128.6.4 will list 128.6.4.1 as the gateway to  those  same  off-campus
networks.    128.6.4.1  is  the  gateway  between networks 128.6.4 and
128.6.3, so it is the first step in getting to JvNC.

When a computer wants to send a datagram, it first checks  to  see  if
the  destination address is on the system's own local network.  If so,
the datagram can be sent directly.  Otherwise, the system  expects  to
find an entry for the network that the destination address is on.  The
datagram is sent to the gateway listed in that entry.  This table  can
get quite big.  For example, the Internet now includes several hundred
individual networks.  Thus various strategies have been  developed  to
reduce  the size of the routing table.  One strategy is to depend upon
"default routes".  Often, there is only one gateway out of a  network.
                                  20
 


This  gateway might connect a local Ethernet to a campus-wide backbone
network.  In that case, we don't need to have  a  separate  entry  for
every  network  in  the  world.    We  simply define that gateway as a
"default".  When no specific  route  is  found  for  a  datagram,  the
datagram  is  sent to the default gateway.  A default gateway can even
be used when there are several gateways  on  a  network.    There  are
provisions  for  gateways  to  send a message saying "I'm not the best
gateway -- use this one instead."  (The message is sent via ICMP.  See
RFC  792.)  Most network software is designed to use these messages to
add entries to their routing tables.  Suppose network 128.6.4 has  two
gateways, 128.6.4.59 and 128.6.4.1.  128.6.4.59 leads to several other
internal Rutgers networks.  128.6.4.1 leads indirectly to the  NSFnet.
Suppose  we  set  128.6.4.59  as  a default gateway, and have no other
routing table entries.  Now what  happens  when  we  need  to  send  a
datagram  to  MIT?    MIT  is  network 18.  Since we have no entry for
network 18, the datagram will be sent to the default, 128.6.4.59.   As
it  happens,  this  gateway  is the wrong one.  So it will forward the
datagram to 128.6.4.1.  But it will also send back an error saying  in
effect: "to get to network 18, use 128.6.4.1".  Our software will then
add an entry to the routing table.  Any future datagrams to  MIT  will
then  go  directly to 128.6.4.1.  (The error message is sent using the
ICMP protocol.  The message type is called "ICMP redirect.")

Most IP experts recommend that individual computers should not try  to
keep  track  of  the  entire network.  Instead, they should start with
default gateways, and let the gateways tell them the routes,  as  just
described.   However this doesn't say how the gateways should find out
about the routes.  The gateways can't depend upon this strategy.  They
have  to  have fairly complete routing tables.  For this, some sort of
routing protocol is needed.  A routing protocol is simply a  technique
for  the  gateways  to  find each other, and keep up to date about the
best way to get to every network.   RFC  1009  contains  a  review  of
gateway  design  and  routing.    However rip.doc is probably a better
introduction to the subject.  It contains some tutorial material,  and
a detailed description of the most commonly-used routing protocol.



7. Details about Internet addresses: subnets and broadcasting


As  indicated earlier, Internet addresses are 32-bit numbers, normally
written as 4 octets (in decimal), e.g. 128.6.4.7.  There are  actually
3  different types of address.  The problem is that the address has to
indicate both the network and the host within the  network.    It  was
felt  that  eventually  there would be lots of networks.  Many of them
would be small, but probably 24 bits would be needed to represent  all
the  IP  networks.  It was also felt that some very big networks might
need 24 bits to represent all of their hosts.  This would seem to lead
to  48  bit  addresses.  But the designers really wanted to use 32 bit
addresses.  So they adopted a kludge.  The assumption is that most  of
the  networks will be small.  So they set up three different ranges of
address.  Addresses beginning with 1 to 126 use only the  first  octet
for  the network number.  The other three octets are available for the
host number.  Thus 24 bits are available for hosts.  These numbers are
                                  21
 


used  for large networks.  But there can only be 126 of these very big
networks.  The Arpanet is one, and there are a  few  large  commercial
networks.    But  few  normal organizations get one of these "class A"
addresses.  For normal large organizations, "class  B"  addresses  are
used.    Class  B  addresses  use the first two octets for the network
number.  Thus network numbers are 128.1 through 191.254.  (We avoid  0
and  255,  for  reasons  that  we  see below.  We also avoid addresses
beginning with 127, because that is used by some systems  for  special
purposes.)    The  last  two  octets  are available for host addesses,
giving 16 bits of host address.   This  allows  for  64516  computers,
which should be enough for most organizations.  (It is possible to get
more than one class B address, if you run  out.)    Finally,  class  C
addresses  use  three  octets,  in  the  range 192.1.1 to 223.254.254.
These allow only 254 hosts on each network, but there can be  lots  of
these  networks.   Addresses above 223 are reserved for future use, as
class D and E (which are currently not defined).

Many large organizations find it convenient to  divide  their  network
number into "subnets".  For example, Rutgers has been assigned a class
B address, 128.6.  We find it convenient to use the third octet of the
address to indicate which Ethernet a host is on.  This division has no
significance outside of Rutgers.  A computer  at  another  institution
would treat all datagrams addressed to 128.6 the same way.  They would
not look at the third octet of the address.   Thus  computers  outside
Rutgers  would  not have different routes for 128.6.4 or 128.6.5.  But
inside Rutgers, we treat 128.6.4 and 128.6.5 as separate networks.  In
effect, gateways inside Rutgers have separate entries for each Rutgers
subnet, whereas gateways outside  Rutgers  just  have  one  entry  for
128.6.  Note  that  we  could  do  exactly  the  same thing by using a
separate class C address for each Ethernet.   As  far  as  Rutgers  is
concerned,  it  would be just as convenient for us to have a number of
class C addresses.  However using class C addresses would make  things
inconvenient for the rest of the world.  Every institution that wanted
to talk to us would have to have a separate entry for each one of  our
networks.   If every institution did this, there would be far too many
networks for any reasonable gateway to keep track of.  By  subdividing
a  class B network, we hide our internal structure from everyone else,
and  save  them  trouble.    This  subnet  strategy  requires  special
provisions in the network software.  It is described in RFC 950.

0  and  255  have  special  meanings.  0 is reserved for machines that
don't know their address.  In certain circumstances it is possible for
a  machine not to know the number of the network it is on, or even its
own host address.  For example, 0.0.0.23 would be a machine that  knew
it was host number 23, but didn't know on what network.

255  is  used for "broadcast".  A broadcast is a message that you want
every system on the network to see.    Broadcasts  are  used  in  some
situations  where you don't know who to talk to.  For example, suppose
you need to look  up  a  host  name  and  get  its  Internet  address.
Sometimes  you  don't know the address of the nearest name server.  In
that case, you might send the request as a broadcast.  There are  also
cases  where a number of systems are interested in information.  It is
then less expensive to send a single broadcast than to send  datagrams
individually  to  each host that is interested in the information.  In
                                  22
 


order to send a broadcast, you use an address that is  made  by  using
your  network  address, with all ones in the part of the address where
the host number goes.  For example, if you are on network 128.6.4, you
would   use   128.6.4.255  for  broadcasts.    How  this  is  actually
implemented depends upon the medium.   It  is  not  possible  to  send
broadcasts  on the Arpanet, or on point to point lines.  However it is
possible on an Ethernet.  If you use an Ethernet address with all  its
bits  on (all ones), every machine on the Ethernet is supposed to look
at that datagram.

Although the official broadcast address for  network  128.6.4  is  now
128.6.4.255,  there  are  some  other addresses that may be treated as
broadcasts by certain implementations.  For convenience, the  standard
also  allows  255.255.255.255 to be used.  This refers to all hosts on
the local network.  It is often simpler to use 255.255.255.255 instead
of  finding out the network number for the local network and forming a
broadcast address such as 128.6.4.255.   In  addition,  certain  older
implementations  may  use  0  instead  of  255  to  form the broadcast
address.    Such  implementations  would  use  128.6.4.0  instead   of
128.6.4.255  as  the  broadcast  address on network 128.6.4.  Finally,
certain older implementations may not understand about subnets.   Thus
they consider the network number to be 128.6.  In that case, they will
assume a broadcast address  of  128.6.255.255  or  128.6.0.0.    Until
support  for  broadcasts is implemented properly, it can be a somewhat
dangerous feature to use.

Because 0 and 255 are used for unknown and broadcast addresses, normal
hosts  should never be given addresses containing 0 or 255.  Addresses
should never begin with 0, 127, or any number above  223.    Addresses
violating these rules are sometimes referred to as "Martians", because
of rumors that the Central University of Mars is using network 225.



8. Datagram fragmentation and reassembly


TCP/IP is designed for use  with  many  different  kinds  of  network.
Unfortunately,  network  designers  do not agree about how big packets
can be.  Ethernet packets can be 1500 octets long.    Arpanet  packets
have  a  maximum  of around 1000 octets.  Some very fast networks have
much larger packet sizes.  At first, you might think  that  IP  should
simply  settle  on  the  smallest  possible size.  Unfortunately, this
would cause serious performance problems.    When  transferring  large
files, big packets are far more efficient than small ones.  So we want
to be able to use the largest packet size possible.  But we also  want
to  be  able  to  handle  networks  with  small limits.  There are two
provisions for this.  First, TCP has the ability to "negotiate"  about
datagram  size.  When a TCP connection first opens, both ends can send
the maximum datagram size they can  handle.    The  smaller  of  these
numbers  is  used  for  the  rest  of the connection.  This allows two
implementations that can handle big datagrams to use  them,  but  also
lets  them  talk  to  implementations that can't handle them.  However
this doesn't completely solve the problem.  The most  serious  problem
is  that the two ends don't necessarily know about all of the steps in
                                  23
 


between.  For example, when sending data between Rutgers and Berkeley,
it is likely that both computers will be on Ethernets.  Thus they will
both  be  prepared  to  handle  1500-octet  datagrams.    However  the
connection will at some point end up going over the Arpanet.  It can't
handle packets of that size.  For this reason, there are provisions to
split   datagrams   up   into   pieces.    (This  is  referred  to  as
"fragmentation".)  The IP header  contains  fields  indicating  the  a
datagram  has  been split, and enough information to let the pieces be
put back together.  If a gateway connects an Ethernet to the  Arpanet,
it must be prepared to take 1500-octet Ethernet packets and split them
into pieces that will fit on the Arpanet.    Furthermore,  every  host
implementation  of  TCP/IP  must  be prepared to accept pieces and put
them back together.  This is referred to as "reassembly".

TCP/IP implementations differ in the approach they take to deciding on
datagram  size.    It  is  fairly  common  for  implementations to use
576-byte datagrams whenever they can't verify that the entire path  is
able  to  handle larger packets.  This rather conservative strategy is
used because of the number of implementations with bugs in the code to
reassemble  fragments.    Implementors  often try to avoid ever having
fragmentation occur.  Different implementors take different approaches
to  deciding  when  it  is safe to use large datagrams.  Some use them
only for the local network.  Others will use them for any  network  on
the   same   campus.    576  bytes  is  a  "safe"  size,  which  every
implementation must support.



9. Ethernet encapsulation: ARP


There was a brief discussion earlier about what IP datagrams look like
on  an  Ethernet.    The  discussion  showed  the  Ethernet header and
checksum.  However it left one hole: It didn't say how to  figure  out
what Ethernet address to use when you want to talk to a given Internet
address.  In fact, there is a separate protocol for this,  called  ARP
("address  resolution protocol").  (Note by the way that ARP is not an
IP protocol.  That is, the ARP datagrams  do  not  have  IP  headers.)
Suppose  you  are  on  system  128.6.4.194  and you want to connect to
system 128.6.4.7.  Your system will first verify that 128.6.4.7 is  on
the  same network, so it can talk directly via Ethernet.  Then it will
look up 128.6.4.7 in its ARP table, to see if  it  already  knows  the
Ethernet  address.    If  so, it will stick on an Ethernet header, and
send the packet.  But suppose this system is not  in  the  ARP  table.
There  is  no  way  to  send the packet, because you need the Ethernet
address.  So it  uses  the  ARP  protocol  to  send  an  ARP  request.
Essentially  an  ARP  request  says  "I  need the Ethernet address for
128.6.4.7".  Every system listens to ARP requests.  When a system sees
an  ARP  request  for itself, it is required to respond.  So 128.6.4.7
will see the request, and will respond with an  ARP  reply  saying  in
effect "128.6.4.7 is 8:0:20:1:56:34".  (Recall that Ethernet addresses
are 48 bits.  This is 6 octets.  Ethernet addresses are conventionally
shown  in  hex,  using  the punctuation shown.)  Your system will save
this information in its ARP table, so future packets will go directly.
Most  systems  treat the ARP table as a cache, and clear entries in it
                                  24
 


if they have not been used in a certain period of time.

Note by the way that ARP requests must be sent as "broadcasts".  There
is  no  way  that  an  ARP  request  can be sent directly to the right
system.  After all, the whole reason for sending  an  ARP  request  is
that  you  don't know the Ethernet address.  So an Ethernet address of
all ones is  used,  i.e.  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.    By  convention,  every
machine  on  the Ethernet is required to pay attention to packets with
this as an address.  So every system sees every ARP  requests.    They
all  look to see whether the request is for their own address.  If so,
they respond.  If not, they could just ignore it.   (Some  hosts  will
use  ARP  requests  to update their knowledge about other hosts on the
network, even if the request isn't for them.)  Note that packets whose
IP  address  indicates broadcast (e.g. 255.255.255.255 or 128.6.4.255)
are also sent with an Ethernet address that is all ones.



10. Getting more information


This directory contains  documents  describing  the  major  protocols.
There  are literally hundreds of documents, so we have chosen the ones
that seem most important.  Internet standards are called RFC's.    RFC
stands  for  Request  for  Comment.   A proposed standard is initially
issued as a proposal, and given an RFC number.   When  it  is  finally
accepted,  it is added to Official Internet Protocols, but it is still
referred to by the RFC number.   We  have  also  included  two  IEN's.
(IEN's  used  to  be  a  separate  classification  for  more  informal
documents.  This classification no longer exists -- RFC's are now used
for  all  official  Internet documents, and a mailing list is used for
more informal reports.)  The convention is that  whenever  an  RFC  is
revised, the revised version gets a new number.  This is fine for most
purposes, but it causes problems with two documents: Assigned  Numbers
and  Official  Internet  Protocols.  These documents are being revised
all the time, so the RFC number keeps changing.  You will have to look
in rfc-index.txt to find the number of the latest edition.  Anyone who
is seriously interested in TCP/IP should read the  RFC  describing  IP
(791).    RFC 1009 is also useful.  It is a specification for gateways
to be used by NSFnet.  As such, it contains an overview of  a  lot  of
the  TCP/IP technology.  You should probably also read the description
of at least one of the application protocols, just to get a  feel  for
the  way  things  work.    Mail is probably a good one (821/822).  TCP
(793) is of course a very basic specification.  However  the  spec  is
fairly  complex,  so  you should only read this when you have the time
and patience to think about it carefully.  Fortunately, the author  of
the  major  RFC's  (Jon Postel) is a very good writer.  The TCP RFC is
far easier to read than you would expect, given the complexity of what
it  is  describing.    You  can  look at the other RFC's as you become
curious about their subject matter.

Here is a list of the documents you are more likely to want:

     rfc-index list of all RFC's

                                  25
 


     rfc1065/6/7
               Simple  Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  A protocol
               to get information from gateways and hosts, to  monitor
               failures,   and   to  reconfigure  gateways  and  hosts
               remotely.  This protocol will  be  the  foundation  for
               network  management  activities  involving TCP/IP.  RFC
               1028 documents the Simple Gateway  Monitoring  Protocol
               (SGMP),  which  is an interim protocol on which SNMP is
               based.  SGMP will be replaced by SNMP during 1988/89.

     rfc1064,1056,937
               protocols for reading mail on PC's

     rfc1062   Assigned  Numbers.  If you are working with TCP/IP, you
               will probably want a hardcopy of this as  a  reference.
               It's  not  very exciting to read, but is essential.  It
               lists all the offically defined  well-known  ports  and
               lots of other things.

     rfc1059   Network  Time  Protocol.   A protocol for synchronizing
               the time on all your machines.  Also allows you to  get
               time from one of the national time standards.

     rfc1058   Routing  Information  Protocol.    Details  of the most
               commonly-used routing protocol.

     rfc1057   RPC.  A protocol for remote  procedure  calls.    Sun's
               Network  File  System is based on this.  The actual NFS
               protocol specification is currently available only from
               Sun.    Sun  supplies a public domain implementation of
               RPC.  Aside from its use by NFS  (whose  implementation
               is not public domain), RPC has been used by a number of
               groups  for  building  server/client  systems  such  as
               remote database servers.  See also RFC 1014.

     rfc1042   IP  encapsulation  for IEEE 802 networks.  This will be
               used for the IEEE  token  ring,  broadband,  etc.    In
               principle  it  seems  that  this  would cover Ethernet,
               since  Ethernet  is  IEEE  802.3.  However  the  normal
               encapsulation used on Ethernet is defined by RFC 894.

     rfc1032/3/4/5
               domains (the database used to go  from  host  names  to
               Internet  address  and back -- also used to handle UUCP
               these days).  This includes protocol standards, as well
               as information directed at people who are going to have
               to set up a domain name server.  Every site should have
               a copy of these documents.

     rfc1014   XDR:  External  Data  Representation Standard.  This is
               part of the specifications for Sun's RPC protocol  (RFC
               1057),  which  is the protocol underlying Sun's Network
               File System.

     rfc1013   X Window System Protocol, Version 11.    Documents  the
                                  26
 


               most commonly used remote window system.

     rfc1012   list  of  all  RFC's  below  1000,  with  somewhat more
               information than rfc-index.

     rfc1011   Official Protocols.  It's useful to scan  this  to  see
               what tasks protocols have been built for.  This defines
               which  RFC's  are  actual  standards,  as  opposed   to
               requests for comments.

     rfc1009   NSFnet  gateway  specifications.  A good overview of IP
               routing and gateway technology.

     rfc1001/2 netBIOS: networking for PC's

     rfc959    FTP (file transfer)

     rfc950    subnets

     rfc894    how IP is to be put on Ethernet, see also rfc825

     rfc854/5  telnet - protocol for remote logins

     rfc826    ARP - protocol for finding out Ethernet addresses

     rfc821/2  mail

     rfc814    names and ports - general  concepts  behind  well-known
               ports

     rfc793    TCP

     rfc792    ICMP

     rfc791    IP

     rfc768    UDP

     ien-116   old  name  server  (still  needed  by  several kinds of
               system)

     ien-48    the  Catenet  model,   general   description   of   the
               philosophy behind TCP/IP

The following documents are somewhat more specialized.

     rfc1055   SLIP (IP for dialup lines)

     rfc1054   IP multicasting

     rfc1048   Bootp,  a protocol often used to allow diskless systems
               to find their IP address.

     rfc813    window and acknowledgement strategies in TCP

                                  27
 


     rfc815    datagram reassembly techniques

     rfc816    fault isolation and resolution techniques

     rfc817    modularity and efficiency in implementation

     rfc879    the maximum segment size option in TCP

     rfc896    congestion control

     rfc827,888,904,975,985
               EGP and related issues

To  those  of you who may be reading this document remotely instead of
at Rutgers: The most  important  RFC's  have  been  collected  into  a
three-volume set, the DDN Protocol Handbook.  It is available from the
DDN Network Information  Center,  SRI  International,  333  Ravenswood
Avenue,  Menlo  Park, California 94025 (telephone: 800-235-3155).  You
should be able to get them via anonymous FTP from sri-nic.arpa.   File
names are:

  RFC's:
    rfc:rfc-index.txt
    rfc:rfcxxx.txt
  IEN's:
    ien:ien-index.txt
    ien:ien-xxx.txt

Sites with access to UUCP but not FTP may be able to retreive them via
UUCP from UUCP host rutgers.  The file names would be

  RFC's:
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/rfc-index.txt
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/rfcxxx.txt
  IEN's:
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/ien-index.txt
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/ien-xxx.txt

Note that SRI-NIC has the entire set of RFC's and IEN's,  but  rutgers
and topaz have only those specifically mentioned above.

** LETTER D70 ***

Hello again fellow GMJ readers.  Lots going on right now here at GMJ.
The first Electronic Print issue is finally out and we have been
overwhelmed by the response.  For those of you who just can't afford
the lengthy download, we have an extremely low price for a
subscription offer.  Check out an ad this issue for all of the
details.

The main theme the last few weeks has to be the 3DO.  Panasonic
released the $700 monster early November and it is taking off pretty
well.  We had a chance to test this money vacuum out recently and we
were pretty impressed.  Check out the Power Switch section this issue
to get all of the hands on test details for the 3DO from the Game
Masters.

You Genesis players will be happy to hear that Mortal Kombat is the
number one selling 16 bit title right now even topping the SNES
version in sales for last month.  Why? I really don't know.  The SNES
version is a much better translation.  I guess this just proves that
MK's blood and gore is what makes it.

You are really going to start to see expanded coverage starting this
issue.  We are still playing around with the formats both Ansi and
Electronic Print.  You probably noticed fact windows in our review
section in issue #32 with a few new pieces of information like megs,
who reviewed the game and average of reviews.  Adding to that, is our
hyper text capsules which will be featured next to random reviews.
These capsules will have game PREviews and tidbits of info.

Don't expect to see GMJ every week anymore, we are changing to
bi-weekly.  The reason is that we can put out a much higher quality
issue in 2 weeks and we have reached a point where it is no longer
necessary to come out weekly.  The Elec- tronic print version will
stay monthly and will come out 12+ times per year.

Those of you reading the Electronic Print version enjoyed some Super
SFII art on our cover done by my sister...I'm sorry.  I really am.  I
didn't want to do it, but Street Fighter is Street Fighter and I had
to do it.  I promise there won't be eight SFII covers with in the next
12 issues! While we are on the subject however, check out some
exclusive Super Street Fighter coverage this issue: All the moves for
every character! (and we even avoided listing those phunky character
profiles.  You know, the ones that tell you how many hours of sleep
Ryu gets before his hard training at the Dojo.)

Hey everybody, before I let you read on, let me remind you to not buy
any new systems until sometime in '95 when Nintendo will release their
recently announced 64 Bit system (which by the way GMJ reported before
ANYONE else) for under $250.....yeah right! Ok, so even if it is so
great, and it is that inexpensive, why am I going to wait until 1995?
Listen, if you are always waiting for the next best thing, you will
never own anything.  I like Sega's approach.  Give us a system when
it's ready, let us enjoy it, and release a new system when it's time.
If I had listened to Nintendo last year trying to convince me not to
buy a Sega CD because their more advanced CD would be here in early
'93 and for less, I would be pretty pissed off right now.

Well, that is it for now.  Enjoy our expanded coverage and additional
sections.

      -  Reny Falzarano  [Da Phunky Pheel One]

Just like Mortal Kombat (but with less hype), Konami's Zombies Ate My
Neighbors was released for the S-NES and Genesis on the same day, so
we here at GMJ decided to run a comparison explaining the differences
in each of the versions.  So sit back and relax, 'cause this is one
wild ride.

Both the S-Nes and Genesis versions share the same story-line; to stop
the hordes of evil from capturing your local towns occupants.  You can
choose to rush into action as either a guy that looks like a follower
of Beavis and Butthead, or a pony tail wielding woman that might be
the twin of Mindy from the tv show "Mork and Mindy".  A two player
cooperative option is available so that you're not alone in this never
ending fight to save your town.

Zombies uses a "tongue in cheek" approach to killing the baddies,
because the weapons you use include a water gun, weed whacker, fire
extinguisher, apples, and other household goodies.  You fight in over
forty levels of never ending mayhem, with some levels including a
local mall, a school, and a maze of hedges.  The enemies in this game
are too numerous to count because they all change according to the
level your playing on.  This unique approach makes the game original,
but there is no attention given to the progress of any story.  The
only real goal is to "tag" the residents of the level before a bad guy
kills them.  The residents are spread out all around the levels, and
each level ends when all the people have either been saved or killed.


S-NES version - 83

The S-NES version and Genesis versions of Zombie both sport the same
levels and the same graphics, but the S-NES uses music and sound a
whole lot more effectively, and the control is be better on this one
as well because of the more buttons used.  The title screen is the
first sign that really shows the differences; the S-Nes version has
the Zombies logo gradually morph into view, where the Genesis version
has very little morphing.  The opening music and voices are also done
better on the S-NES version.

The play mechanics and control are a lot better on the S-NES version
because it's full screen, while the Sega version has a two inch black
bar running along the entire right side of the screen.  Just being
able to see more of the screen adds to the S-NES Zombies, because you
have more time to react to the oncoming enemies.  The graphics are
also larger than those for the Sega version and playing them both
right after each other really shows which is superior.

Not only is the screen size a difference in the two Zombies, but the
music, when compared to each other, is a total blowout with the
S-NES's better sound capabilities destroying the Sega version.  Hooked
up to a stereo system, the Zombies soundtrack booms with some house
shaking bass and some of the better video game sounds on the market
being used.  Real samples of screams and explosions were used to give
a sense of realism to Zombies, while the rest of the game comes off as
a B-movie style game with many cliches being used.

Genesis version - 70

The Sega version of Zombies and I got off to a bad start; I played
Zombies on my S-NES and expected an almost identical version on the
Sega.  I was wrong.  The programmers took a shotty approach in the
making of the Sega version, and I was honestly disappointed with the
whole game.  The two inch black bar is probably the thing that stands
out most as an example of bad programming.  It takes up way to much
room on the screen, and it's only use is to show the score, weapons
left, and a mapping system which shows you where the citizens are; all
of which was done on the regular screen for the S-NES.

Bar aside, the graphics in this game are the same on both versions,
with only a slight color loss on the Sega version being the
difference.  Zombies is not compatible with the six button controller,
which would have been ideal with this type of game.  Assigning
multiple weapons to the top buttons could have added a lot to the game
play.  In the area of sound, the Sega version lacks the same
instrumental quality that the S-NES Zombies had, and the sound effects
seemed to be shorter with a scratchy digitized sound that accompanied
them.  I can understand how the music might be below the S-NES
standards, but allowing the Genesis Zombies to be plagued by a huge
bar really brought this game down.


   Here's How They Stacked Up HEAD TO HEAD :

Overall, the concept and ideas for Zombies showed a lot of originality
on both versions, and the two player option adds a lot to the
re-playability of this game.  But when put side to side, the S-NES
version really outperforms the Sega Zombies in both playability and
overall appearance.  Unlike Mortal Kombat where the Genesis version
had the blood where the S-NES one didn't, the Sega Zombies has no
superior qualities over it's S-NES counterpart, and people who are
interested in buying this game will easily pick up a copy of the Super
Nintendo version over the Sega Genesis version.

Hello all of you GMJers.  If you want to write to us letting us know
what you think of the new version, old version, how much you hate us
or love us, or have any video game questions that you hope to be
published, write to us at the addresses above.  We are trying to set
up ID's for ALL of our writers on these boards, but until we do, just
write to the ID's above.  Everyone sees every letter.  This edition of
Express Mail, we only selected letters strictly magazine related since
the theme seems to be our new version.  Since some of the questions
were really good, we thought it would be a good and simple way to
explain exactly how everything will work.  However, keep sending your
game questions and other such mail because next issue will resume
regular procedures...

*** Slow baud? No problem.
I was on Prodigy and I read some promotional letters from you guys
about the graphic version of the magazine.  I assume it is a big file
and I only have a 2400 modem.  Is there another way to get the new
version?

H. Cavelerio
Westford, Ma

{ Phunky: Just recently we decided to give away the magazine through
{ the mail in addition to the downloads.  All you have to do is write
{ us on any of our boards in which we read mail.  Give us your
{ address and we will send you the print issues monthly.

*** Win-dozer
Why is your new version only for windows? I don't have windows and I
have been with you guys almost the whole time! Now you exclude me?
THANKS A LOT!

Norman Lewis
Boston, Ma

{ Phunky:
{ Hey Norm, CALM DOWN! We reconfigured the whole project.  At first it
{ was only going to be for windows, but we found some better ways of
{ doing the mag.  Now anyone with a PC can view our mag through DOS!

*** But, you aren't EGM!
GMJ rules, don't get me wrong.  But we need some overseas coverage.  I
want to know what's coming, when it's coming and how much it's gonna
be!

Michael Watson
Boston, Ma

{ Phunky:
{ Mike, I guess you will be a very happy camper as you read the
{ upcoming issue of GMJ.  We are expanding into a full coverage
{ magazine.  Look for upcoming game lists, Japanese news, sales and
{ rental figures and a lot more!

*** Recent fan wants pictures
I've been a follower of your mag ever since issue #23, and I've seen
great improvements in both the layout and overall quality of the
reviews.  Your info is out months before the other published mags, so
I really don't have a reason to buy them anymore.  The only problem I
see is that you can't have pictures of the games online.  Other than
that, GMJ is my favorite video gaming mag on and it's free!! Keep up
the good work.

Hey SFII fans, it's renew your lease on your Genesis...AGAIN! Quite
possibly one of the most amazing feats accomplished on the Genesis so
far is the latest version of SFII from Capcom.  Every year, you think
that the good old Genny is just a little too outdated, but bang,
programming hits a new level and you keep it for another year.  Games
like SFIISCE keep Sega players happy, and the video game market going.

Judging by the name, you may think it is just the Champion Edition
standing alone, however just like on the SNES, the Turbo and Hyper
Fighting options are included.  But unlike the SNES version, the Sega
version packs a tournament option.

When you first snag this cart of the shelf and plug it in to your
Genesis, there is simply nothing that is going to fully prepare you
for what you are going to experience.  Every last animation is here,
perfectly translated to the Sega format.  Choose from any of the 12
characters in either of their snazzy uniforms (depending what mode you
are playing in).  The backgrounds amazingly enough look spectacular
even in the 64 color display.  The smooth parallax scrolling,
simulating 3D effect and the soft textured presentation of the
characters are only a small part of this flickerless phenomenon.

Anyone planning on picking this cart up, should really consider buying
one of Sega's little 6 button controllers to go with it.  Not only
does the controller give you true arcade control for a great price
($20), but it is also the best available controller on the market
priced under $40.  With the 6 button controller, this is the best
playing version of the game yet.  Too bad this game was not made
compatible with Sega's upcoming 4 player adapter, the tournament mode
would have fit so perfectly.

The tournament mode is a great opportunity for you and your buddies to
get together and find out who the real champ is.  There are 2 tourney
options.  The first one allows each person competing to select 6
different fighters to use.  Whoever wins the most matches is obviously
the winner.  This mode is great to show up those 1 dimensional players
who can only use one or two characters.  The second mode, the
Elimination Mode, allows to select from one to six characters.  You
fight one round battles and whoever defeats all their opponents first
wins.

If speed is what you need, you will be exuberantly excited to find out
that just like the SNES version, this version is actually faster than
the arcade since you can choose from a total of ten speeds (no code
necessary this version).

Ahh, there had to be one downer.  The voices.  Although the music is
pretty good the voices and sound effects were completely horrible.  A
disappointing con since we have seen a lot of great effects and sounds
on other previous Genny carts.  I assume this was all due to lack of
memory.  Even at 24 meg, they ran out of room to improve on the sound,
but that is ok because the rest of the game is near perfect.

It's finally here folks.  Many thought it would never come, but it did
and in a big way.  SFIISCE is one of the hottest carts this year on
the Genesis with amazing graphics, control and speed.  Only thing I
can say that is wrong with it besides the sound, is that it was based
on the SNES version, not the arcade.  The characters are small just
like on the SNES and they did not truly add the Turbo
backgrounds...however, this is GENESIS!

        Here's how they stacked up HEAD TO HEAD:

For some nitty gritty comparisons, you should check out our review
last issue of the SNES version, but here are some of the points we
came up with.

o The Genesis version is just as fast with no code needed.
o The characters are animated just as well, and graphics are just as
  spectacular.
o The SNES version has a much brighter and colorful appearance and
  that is hands down a big plus.
o The sound on the SNES version is great, the voices are ok, but the
  both the sound and voices on the Genny version rotted!
o The control was great on both versions.  With the 6 button
  controller, the Genesis version played better.  Using the 3 button
  controller, the SNES version played better.  The music was really
  good on both version, but I have to give the SNES version the edge.
o Both versions offer small characters, and unfinished backgrounds.
o The Genesis version offers a great tournament mode not found on any
  other version.

Ranger-X represents what an older concept along with newer technology
can create and along with it a new realm in video gaming.  Space
shooters have been used time and time again, but Ranger-X from Gao (a
new Sega development team) twists the idea along with a side scrolling
shooter to make a game that is actually original in today's market.

Your character is a huge metal suited figure, equipped with a standard
blaster and a second weapon which can be switched at any time in the
game.  This second weapon has it's own power meter which drops when
it's being used.  An Ex-Up vehicle follows along behind you and can
become a part of you by standing on it and pressing down to crouch
inside the vehicle.  While on the Ex-Up you can choose what your
second weapon is from an assortment of lasers to a flame thrower.  The
Ex-Up automatically follows your character throughout the level, and
with the six button controller, you can control it by using the top
buttons.

Flying is a big part of this game as your main guy can take to the air
because of the engine hooked up to your back.  The engine is limited
to just a few seconds of flying, but with practice, hovering in one
place can make it so you're in the air for longer periods of time.
Your character and the other motorized attackers all animate very
fluidly on screen, and the amount of color and parallax scrolling on
the levels in incredible.  Each level has you going after a series of
targets that must be destroyed before going onto the boss encounter.
Some levels have you going on one set path, while others like level
two have you exploring certain areas to find the targets.

The button combinations are unique in that button A makes you face
left and let's you fire in that direction, while button C faces you
right.  Button B uses the special weapon and up takes you to the
skies.  The backgrounds in this game all use a tremendous amount of
color, and the foregrounds and sprites all use color effectively.  The
explosions are realistic looking, which is a given for a shooter style
game.  The popular use of parallax found in the floor of the Street
Fighter II levels can be found here in level three with a 3-D tunnel
that looks like you're really walking past it.  This might not add
much to the actual game, but it's great for the visual aspect of the
game.

The music is some phunky tunes that fit into this game perfectly.
Listening to this game with a pair of headphones really adds to the
game because it makes you feel like you're in the game.  The
explosions shake the house literally, and the gunfire is represented
with realistic digitized sounds.  Other newsworthy portions of this
game include some software scaling of some enemy ships and at the
beginning of each level a series of lines that represent building
scales and rotates around the screen and scale toward the viewer.

The downsides of Ranger-X include the very hard nature of the game and
the awkward controls that take time to master and to feel comfortable
with.  The good points are the great graphics and presentation of the
levels and the overwhelming sounds that happen during the action.  The
addition of the Ex-Up really improves the game-play of the game, and
the bosses and enemies all seem to come at you at once.  Ranger-X has
some great strategic levels, and is a game for the hard core gamer
that can beat most games on hard.  Along with Gunstar Heroes, Sega
seems to be focusing a lot of attention on action games now-a-days
which means we'll be seeing a lot of good quality games come Christmas
time.  Ranger-X is just superb.

Sr. Jnx-90
The sights and sounds in Ranger-X just blew me away! The Ex-Up rover
was a great idea that can be used as an option in future games.  The
scaling lines in-between levels weren't needed, and the difficulty was
just too hard for most gamers.

Mr. Mojo Risin'-92
This game just simply rocks!! Everything is perfect from the huge
amount of colors to the great sound effects.

Leave all your premonitions and beliefs of what your Sega Genesis can
do in the closet, because Sega has probably destroyed every boundary
of what the Genesis is "supposed to do" in it's newest game, Gunstar
Heroes.  Gunstar is in a league of it's own; never before have a
combination of graphics, sound, game-play, software techniques, and
overall fun been all applied to the same game with such magnitude.

Gunstar Heroes is the newest side-scrolling action game to be released
on the Genesis, and while not having the popular movie names to it or
any flashy ad campaigns, has succeeded in mixing the perfect blend of
non-stop action and game-play into one 8-meg cart.  The on-screen
action can only be described as furious, with as many as ten enemies
on screen at once, and clocked at speeds just under a weighted down
Sonic.  Enemies come from everywhere, and attack from just about every
point of angle on the screen.

At the beginning of the game you get to choose your characters
fighting style; either being able to fire your weapon as you run or an
option that makes you have to stand still while you fire your weapon.
Next, you get to choose which of the four beginning levels you'll
start out at, and then a quick rundown on the level you chose.  From
here on out is non-stop action that has to be seen to be believed.

There are four primary weapons in Gunstar: a laser, a fire thrower, a
seek and destroy weapon, and a flame thrower.  The weapons are spread
out all around the levels and can be upgraded by finding and picking
up that weapons icon.  An original idea used in this game is that the
weapons can be mixed so that a brand new weapon is made (ie.  if you
pick up the fire thrower and the tracking weapon, the weapon becomes a
huge line of flame that seeks out enemies.) This new weapon set-up
makes for some great trial and error situations where you must decide
which weapon must be used in what situation.

Scaling and rotation have never looked this good on the Sega Genesis.
Through software techniques, almost flawless rendering of objects is
possible.  Most of the bosses use at least some special technique in
the way they attack or more around the screen.  One such boss is a
series of boxes in the form of a human figure which rotates around the
screen and has the most lifelike movements that I've ever seen in a
box.  The rest of the graphics in this game are cartoonish in nature,
but are done with superb color usage and some great animations.  A lot
of detail went into the making of this game, with great shading and
backgrounds on all of the levels, and a lot of attention in keeping
the action intense at all points in the game.

The first four levels can be beaten in any order, and doing so is no
cake walk.  Each level has several mini-bosses and an end boss that
makes you use all the skills of the character.  Your character can
shoot in any direction, be it up, down, sideways, or in any diagonal
direction.  Your character can also do a slide sweep which takes a lot
of damage off the enemies, and a combination of a throw or a body
slam/jump kick.  Hanging from ceilings and ledges is also possible,
and aerial throws and combinations are also possible.  Two of the
levels have you riding in a separate vehicle; one being in a scooter
that can defy gravity, and the other one in a spaceship for a mini
outer space shooter.  Game-play has never reached these heights, with
an improvement only possible with the use of a six button capability
not found in this game.  The levels themselves also have unique things
to cling from and to climb on.  One level is set on an aircraft in the
sky while another is a huge monopoly game with multiple baddies to
beat up on.  Older twists such as reappearing bosses has also been
used so that the boss count in this game is over fifteen guys.

Games with great graphics or a lot software techniques usually end up
having one area of the game being less than standard.  This is not
true with Gunstar though, because the music and sounds in this game
are THE best I've ever heard on the Genesis.  The background music
pounds out some hard rock tunes while the on screen action is heard
with some heart stopping explosions and non-stop gunfire.  Every
action has it's own sound effect so your neighbors may complain that
there's a war going on in your bedroom.

One feature that I didn't mention above is that Gunstar is a two
player game also.  After testing it out though, we found that some
slow down was found in some levels because of it, but not enough to
hurt the game in any way.  To add to the replay value, Gunstar has the
perfect difficulty curve that actually affects the attacks of the
enemies (ie.  on easy, there are several "spots" where you can stand
when fighting a boss and not get hurt, but while on the other settings
you can get hurt anywhere.) To me, Gunstar is almost the perfect game.
Everything is done to perfection, with action unequaled in any
earlier attempts at a side-scrolling action game, and that is as fun
to watch as it is to be playing.  Hopefully, more games will be made
with this being the game to match in overall quality and
professionalism.  Goods news for us though, because this game is just
screaming sequel.

Phunky Pheel One-96 Wow!
This game sets new standards for video games in general.  Not only are
the graphics some of the best, but the sounds and playability are up
there with other classics like Contra and Mega Man.  To bad the
creators of this game are working on a McDonalds game and not a sequel
to Gunstar Heroes!

Anderson-90
Gunstar Heroes shows that with a lot of programming a game can surpass
the expectations of a system.  I couldn't believe the amount of action
on screen at once.  The two player adaption was a great addition to a
game that needs no improvements and has the best moves this side of
Street Fighter.

Pepperidge Farmer-97
Perfect man, perfect! I've been playing this game non-stop ever since
the GMJ offices got it in.  The many smiles this game gave me is worth
the price, no prob.  One or two more levels would have made this game
a 100.

GENESIS NEWZ CLIP:
Redo it! The preliminary version of Tournament Fighters from Konami on
the Genesis looked pathetic, however after retooling and refining
backgrounds and animation, the Genny version is starting to look up.
The hyped up Eternal Champions from Sega is one of the best looking
games for the holidays.  The new texture techniques used will be
making this one of the most impressive graphical displays on the
Genesis EVER!

...by, Da Phunky Pheel One, Ace, Sr. Jnx and others...

Welcome back all to another exciting issue.
This issue we are featuring 2 special reviews of games that appear on
both the SNES and Genesis.  If you have trouble deciding which
version of a game to get, GMJ will now be doing side by side
comparisons of any game that appears on 2 or more systems.  Next
issue you can look forward to over 15 reviews and a special
Electronic Arts insert reviewing ALL the four way play games, as well
as 2 3DO reviews.

Macromdeia announced recently to develop a player which would allow
Director Macintosh or Windows files to be compatible on the 3DO.
This is the first bid to direct the 3DO as a business utility and not
just a video game console.  Marketing the 3DO directly to compete
with Macs and PC's would certainly strenghten the list of pros for
the 3DO as we here at GMJ are not very convinced that the 3DO is
strictly a video game unit.

In Segaland there is many a rumor flying around about the Saturn.
Sega may ditch the old format and hop right on to a 64 bit project
with the same title which would be a CD based unit that would play
Sega CD format games as well as regular Genesis titles.  Our source
for this rumor was very bleak so that is all we can say right now.
If we find any backbone or followup information to that story, you
will be updated...But for what we CAN tell you right now not to
expect this super system until late '94.  At the earliest.

Any Genesis owner who feels depribed for some reason that only SNES
players will be enjoying the horrible SFII/MK ripoff, Clayfighters
can rejoyce.  Interplay, makers of the SNES game Clayfighters has
singed on to the Sega 3rd party crew with a Genesis version of
Clayfighters.

Some possible last second changes to Sonic CD might be a replacement
of the cinema scenes.  We hate to throw another rumor at you but we
have to.  The grapevine has it that the current cinemas to Sonic CD
will be replaced by segments of the Saturday version of the cartoon.
As long as they don't delay the game because of this, I don't care,
otherwise...WHY?!?!

All of you Sega/health freaks (and those two things are just so
complimantary of each other) can have fun with an upcoming excersise
unit from the company Hearbeat.  This unit plugs into the Genesis
control port and its directional controls are hooked up to an
exersise bike (provided by you).  You setup a workout which will be
interactive with a game.  The concept of the packin game (Outback
Joey) is to go through levels and fight off bad guys while mantaining
a certain heart rate.  There may also be an NHL game in development
for this unique attachment...?

Nearly three weeks ago the long awaited Panasonic 3DO multimedia unit
was released nationwide for a retail of $700.  Available for our
hands on test was one pack-in game wad Crash and Burn - a futuristic
racing game.  For what we had been expecting, believe it or not some
at GMJ were somewhat disappointed.  Before you decide to stop reading
our magazine forever though, hear me out.  The scaling, graphics and
manipulation of the objects and backgrounds was incredible, however
the movement and interaction with the car and backgrounds was poorly
done.  Then we thought it was not fair to judge a first title so
strictly, and when compared to say an Altered beast or Super Mario
World (in ratio), it is needless to say that Crash and Burn is a
king.

I was disappointed in the marketing of this unit.  Thrown in every
video game section of every store, the 3DO is now directed as a way
too expensive video game unit, instead of a next wave multimedia
entertainment business and networking unit and possibly the
replacement for VCR and alternate to an expensive PC that it is.
Instead of packing the unit with a keyboard or control panel, the
system is packed with a video game controller and the "bare" system
is not fully capable of running full length full motion video discs.
A special cartridge upgrade has to be installed.  These are all some
major mistakes because at $700 no one is purchasing this system so
they can play Madden football...and if they are, they got some
problems.

Ok, so you are all thinking how bad we are dogging this unit.  NO NO
NO! Not at all.  I am convinced this will be the entertainment unit
of the future hands down.  The possibilities of the 3DO are endless.
We just thought that their marketing approach was all wrong.  Why
should I spend $700 that is not loaded with some of the standard
features it was supposed to COME with when in 9 months another 3DO
system will be released for $500 with internal full motion
capabilities, a keyboard, and a mouse?

Let there be no mistake.  This IS the future of entertainment.  This
is a video game system, interactive TV, fax machine, VCR and more all
in one unit.

Check out next issue where we will give you a FULL coverage report
and review the games.

Lets get right to the chase gang, this is one HELL of a game! The
game that started the craze, Street Fighter, has it's third upgrade
now, this time with new everything! 4 new characters, redrawn
graphics, re-sampled sounds...  it's all here! NEW MOVES TOO!

Unless you have lived in a CAVE for the last 30 months, you know that
the object of Street Fighter is to beat your foe in a
two-out-of-three falls match.  There are SIXTEEN characters to choose
from, each with their own fighting style.  Some throw fireballs, some
are great with their hands while others are blazing fast.  It is up
to you to find a character that best macthes your playing style.

You play against 12 of the 16 characters when you play against the
computer, and the first 11 are randomly selected.  The final
character you face is M.Bison, the evil druglord/dictator of Thailand
who has spread his evil world-wide.

When someone else puts their credits in the machine, the game goes
into a head-to-head mode.  You then must fight to stay on the machine
because the loser goes home!

One of the Game of the Year candidates, this one will blow you away!

Ace - 95
The ONLY problem I had with this game was the fact that the sounds,
although they sound GREAT with Q-sound, are AWEFULLY DONE! This
sounds like a NEO*GEO game! But other than that..  LOOK OUT!

====================================================================
                             WARP ZONE!
====================================================================

SUPER STREET FIGHTER MOVES:  All of the new ones BEFORE EGM,
                             GamePro, VG + Die Hard Game Fan.

NOTE: Although this LOOKS like some posts on the Internet, this is
      NOT a 'steal', we did find these moves, these are OUR strat's
      and all of these moves are listed correctly.  (IF not, tell
      us, and we'll fix it!)


====================================================================
Cammy
====================================================================
Special Moves:
Spear kick:           |  \  --o  +  kick
                      o   o

Spinning Backhand: /  |  \  +  punch
                  o   o   o

Crescent Kick:  --o  |  \  + kick
                     o   o

Pile-driving Suplex (Pileplex):  --o  +  fierce kick
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Back Suplex: --o  +  fierce punch
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Ariel Throw:  --o  +  medium kick

Comments:
Spear Kick: Cammy launxhes herself horizontally, close to the ground,
at the opponent.  This is actually her worst move, but it can be used
it combos very easily.  The only problem with it is that it has
horrible recovery time.  This can be dealt with by doing the short
spear kick from the limit of its range so that while your opponent is
recovering from the block, you can be recovering from the kick.  It
also places you at the maximum distance from the opponent.  It also
only goes about half way across the screen before stopping.  It can
be used to stop projectiles like Blanka and Honda, but it is best
used as a defensive maneuver.

Spinning Backhand: This looks like a quick spin followed by a guile
backhand.  It has the capability of hitting twice, and when it does
it does a great deal of damage.  Secondly, when Cammy is spinning on
her heals she is invincible.  But you have to have perfect timing,
since you are vulnerable before and after this point.  It can be used
like Balrog's TAP to dodge fireballs, but it is more difficult to
time.  Because you move so far forward, you will probably want to use
the jab spinning backhand, otherwise you will end up within sweeping
distance.  The move is fairly slow, but if used correctly, deadly.

Crescent Kick: This is basically a dragon punch with her foot, and it
is her best move.  It has a trajectory that is wider than Ken's
fierce DP, and it is also invincible (except against Ken/Ryu's Dragon
Punch) while going up.  The intital frames are vulnerable, though, so
it cant be used exactly like the DP.

Combos:
    If Ken or Ryu throw a fireball, do the following...
      Spinning Backhand, short kick, Crescent Kick (3 to 5 hit combo)
    If Guile shows Sonic Boom or Dee Jay shows Ace rusher, do...
      Spinning Backhand, Crescent Kick (2 to 4 hit combo)

Overall:
Cammy is one of the best new characters in the game, according to
most people.  She has good speed and air-priority to rival Chun Li.
She seems to be played in the same style as Chun Li, but with the
added advantage of the uppercut-like kick.  She is great at anti-air
defense, also.

====================================================================
T-Hawk
====================================================================
Special Moves:

Mexican Typhoon:        full 360 degrees on joystick + punch
(aka Phi Slamma Jamma)  (like zangief's spinning pile driver)

Condor Dive:  Jump + (all three punches)

Tomahawk Buster:   --o  |  \  +  punch
                        o   o

Face Smash:   --o + fierce punch

Face Chop:   --o + roundhouse

Throw:  medium punch

Comments:
Mexican Typhoon: Hawk grabs you, plams your head like a basketball,
jumps in the air, windmills you in the air 720 degress, then slams
you into the ground head first.  If you want to impress the hell out
of everyone around you, this is the move to do.  It has a pretty
decent range, about the length for dahlsim to throw.

Condor Dive: T-Hawk jumps, then suddenly dives at you like dahlsim's
yoga spear.  This move can be deceptive - try jumping back, then
diving with the condor dive.  It has a good range, but can only be
done on the way up, not on the way down.  It can be useful for
countering fireballs.

Tomahawk Buster: Another version of the DP, but this goes more
diagonal and is not as quick.  It is only invincible for a very short
time at the beginning, then the rest is vulnerable.  The fierce TB
extends really far - farther than ken's DP - and can also hit twice
if close enough.  It has a pretty nasty fall distance, so it can be
risky.  But the delay when you reach the ground is minimal.

Combos:
Roundhouse neck kick- standing forward- fierce tomahawk buster.

The tick standing short - into mexican typhoon seems to work, but not
as well as Zangief's.

Overall:
T-Hawk seems to be a very versatile character.  His biggest weakness
is his speed, but that can be made up for by his big moves.  His
spinning leg sweep is also a nice move, and it executes faster than
Guile's fierce trip.  His kicks have decent range - much better than
Ken, Ryu, Zangief, and Chun Li's, i would say.  His standing forward
is really nice - it has about a Ryu crouching roundhouse range,
sticks out straight, and is fast.

====================================================================
Dee-Jay
====================================================================
Special Moves:

Machine Gun Upper:   |  o  +  (punch, punch, punch...)
                     o  |

Ace Rusher:  --o  +  punch
             (charge)

Hop Step and a Kick:     o--   --o  +  kick
                       (charge?)

Dee Jay Escape:    | + roundhouse kick
                   o
Comments:
Machine Gun Upper: If you hit the button once, you get a jab-like
uppercut.  Tapping a punch button repeatedly after executin the move
will extend the punch further.  It works well as a defensive move, as
it will stop most characters from jumping in.  It is difficult to hit
more than a few times, but it has been done up to four.

Ace Rusher: This looks and works like guile's sonic boom, but is
different because it has a long recovery time and his body leans way
forward when performing it.

Hop Step and a Kick: He sort of kicks, turns around, and kicks again.
Crouching Roundhouse: This is like dahlsim's slide.  It can be used
against someone who is jumping in at you, but unfortunately it cant
go under fireballs.  If the timing is right, you can follow up a
fireball with this.

Combos:
   jumping hit - standing forward - fireball
   jumping hit - standing short - short spinning kick

Overall:
Dee Jay seems to be one of the better characters and will be
especially useful to those who know how to use Guile.  His far
standing fierce is a good anty-air attack, and his jump + roundhouse
hits far enough down to hit Dahlsim's crouching fierce.  His jumps
are his biggest flaw.  The lower part of his body hangs really low,
which makes it hard to jump over fireballs.  Fireball traps seem to
work very well against him, since jumping is difficult and he lacks
any invincible move.

====================================================================
Fei Long
====================================================================

Special Moves:

Triple Punch:   |  \  --o  +  punch (repeat,
                o   o                repeat...)

Flaming Vertical Kick:   o--  |   /  +  kick
                              o  o

Leaping Double Kick:   --o  +  roundhouse

Flip-over throw:   --o +  roundhouse
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Comments:
Triple Punch: Doing the fireball motion once will give you a flaming
jab.  Doing it again quickly will cause him to slide forward a bit
and follow up with a straight punch.  A third time finishes the move
with another punch.  He rushes at you faster than Balrog's rushing
punches, but it is hard to get the timing right to get multiple hits.
Practice makes perfect!

Flaming Kick: He jumps into the air with his leg on fire.  The
horizontal range is non-existant.  The height is determined by which
kick you use.  It is a bit safer than a dragon punch because if you
do it too soon, you might be in a defensive crouch.  If you do it too
late, you will still be blocking.  It seems to be mainly a defensive
move.

Leaping Kick: Fei Long jumps at you with a double kick.  It does
pretty decent damage.  Although he spends a lot of time moving
forward with no attack out, once the attack comes out it has one hell
of a priority.

Combos:
This combo is great against the larger characters (Zangief, Hawk)
Jumping roundhouse, short kick, Triple punch over + over

Overall:
He has the potential to be the next anti-character, like Guile was
for Ken/Ryu.  Use him against characters without projectiles for the
best chance of victory.

===================================================================
Ryu
===================================================================
Dragon Punch: --o | \  + punch
                  o  o

   Still the superior move in the game.  Deadly, but not as damaging.

Red Fireball:   o--  /  |  \  --o  +  punch
                    o   o   o
This is a red fireball that will burn the opponent like Dhalsim's
yoga fire.

Fireball:  | \  --o + punch
           o  o

He has a longer delay after his fireball and his hurricane kick now
starts spinning on the way up and all the way down, following his
jump motion.

Hurricane Kick: |  / o-- + kick
                o o
Air Hurricane Kick: Jump then HK motion

The kick still does tons of damage.  the Air HK now follows the
motion of his normal jump (arced).  The sooner you do the HK motion
during your jump, the higher you'll fly.

====================================================================
Ken
====================================================================
Changes to his DP - fierce now burns opponent and can hit 3 times.
Jab hits once and knocks down.  His hurricane kick is also like
Ryu's.  Does not have a flaming fireball..  but other than that, see
Ryu.

==============================================================================
Chun Li
==============================================================================
Fireball:   o--   --o  +  punch
         (charge)

The new fireball.
ONLY use in a situation where your opponent will definitely either be
hit (like in a combo) or will have to block (such as when an opponent
is just getting up).  The delay AFTER the fireball is even longer
than the delay in HF and the fireball (actually, it looks like a raw
egg being tossed) dissipates (dissapears) before crossing the screen.
The faster the fireball, the shorter the distance.

Helicopter Kick: | (charge) o + kick
                 o          |

The altered Helicopter kick
MUCH better against opponents jumping in, as the animation sequence
where Chun is just beginning to flip over now knocks the opponent
down (doesn't leave them standing to retaliate).  Works great vs.
Ken/Ryu, and Long.  Haven't tried it vs.  anyone else yet.  Her
aerial Helicopter (where she goes into it quickly after jumping) is
strange, but I imagine helpfull against corner traps, as it arcs in
the path of her natural jump, and goes by kinda fast.  This is one of
the more important positive changes made.

Combos:
jumping hit - standing fierce - fireball/lightning kick jumping neck
fierce - standing strong - standing fierce - lightning kick jumping
fierce - standing strong - crouching forward.

==============================================================================
Zangief
==============================================================================
Zangief's Power Moves:  360 spin from forward to down
                        and back around to front and....

    punch       -- old faithful, the SPD (spinning pile driver)
    kick        -- charge throw, or CPD (charge pile driver)
    kick (close)-- drop then flip and leap into air with them,
                       or FPD (flip pile driver)

Knee Drop:  o (hold) + fierce
            |

     No more one-hit dizzy.

Air Throws: He has TWO air throws
    fierce (and forward)--almost exactly like Z's old crouch strong throw,
       but in the air.
    roundhouse (and forward)--almost exactly like his old crouch fierce, but
       in the air--nabs them and with no pause heaves them in the air over
       his shoulder (doesn't look up like he did before)

Throws: finally got all but one normal throw checked out.
         Strong--simple pile driver from before.
         Fierce--iron claw aka far+strong from older versions
        Forward--new suplex ala fierce from older versions--heaves opponent
                 over head, then falls back, but this time he ends up
                 horizontal about 1 inch from the ground, and then you fall
down.
     Roundhouse--chin smash ala far+fierce from before
  crouch fierce--gut wrench as older versions.


==============================================================================
Blanka
==============================================================================
Blanka Ball: o--  --o + punch
          (charge)

  Still one of the fastest moves in the game.

Vertical Ball: | (charge) o + kick
               o          |

Flip Roll:  o--   --o  +  kick
        (charge)

Blanka flips back, then does a roll that has an arc to it.  If timed
right, it can go over fireballs.

He is improved in someways, DIES in others.  He now stops rolling in
his vertical roll and goes back down at an angle so he cant be swept
or dragon punched so easily.  Also, the timing of his rolls are such
that, if blocked, a quick fireball will hit it on the way down.

====================================================================
Honda
====================================================================
Thousand Hand Slap: Punch buttons over and over

   Great for corner-trapping.

Banzai Drop: | (charge) o + kick
             o          |

==============================================================================
Guile
==============================================================================
Sonic Boom:  o--  --o + punch
           (charge)

   An ever BETTER recovery than before!

Flash Kick (aka Razor Kick):  | (charge) o + kick
                              o          |

  The range for this has been dropped a bit.  More defensive now.

Mid-Air Back Breaker: --o + punch

Pretty good priority.  Watch out for mis-timing..  you need to be
almost touching to pull the move off.

====================================================================
Dhalsim
====================================================================
Dhalsim Disappear:
   --o | \  + punch  OR o-- |  / + punch
       o  o   kick          o o    kick

Either forward DRP will put you in front of your foe, either backward
will put you behind him or her.  Punch = far away, kick = near.

Fireball: | \  --o + punch
          o  o

   Just as good as Ken and Ryu's!

Yoga Flame: o-- / | \  --o
               o  o  o

   This hangs around for a LONG while!

====================================================================
Balrog
====================================================================
Buffalo Headbutt:   |   o  +  punch
                    o   |
               (charge)
   Yet another variation on the DP.

Charge Punch: o-- --o + punch = straight
               (charge) kick  = uppercut

Turn Around Punch: HOLD ALL 3 KICK then let go

This move no longer lets you go through fireballs.

Here's the bottom line:
        Power DOWN.

Against anyone w/o a fireball, Balrog will roast 'em.  Easy.
Against anyone WITH a fireball, well, you're gonna have to work.  And
hard.

Overall, he's still a power to face.... if you use him, good luck.

====================================================================
Vega
====================================================================
Air Spiral:   |  o  or o +  punch
              o   \   /
          (charge)
Vega jumps off the wall like he is going to do a claw dive, but then
dives head first across the screen in mid air.  He picks the wall
depending on where you point (up-left or up-right.)

Spread Eagle: |    o +  punch
              o    |
            (charge)

Wall Dive - Suplex: |          o  + kick, then PUNCH when near
                    o (charge) |                     your foe.

====================================================================
Sagat
====================================================================
Tiger Shots:  | \  --o + punch = high Tiger Shot
              o  o       kick  = low Tiger Shot

Tiger Uppercut: --o | \  + punch
                    o  o
                 o
Tiger Knee: / | /  + kick
           o  o

  About the only change is that his tiger knee now goes further.

====================================================================
Bison
====================================================================
Flying Dive:  |  o  +  punch
              o  |
          (charge)
He jumps really high and then comes down and hits you on the head
with his fist.

Anti-Grav Kick: |  o +  kick
                o  |
              (charge)

Still defies gravity with this jump, after it hits you can attack
again in mid-air!

Bison Torpedo :      o--    --o + punch
(aka Psycho Chrusher) (charge)

   Only hits at MOST 3 times.

  Scissor Kick: o--  --o + kick
            (charge)

   Always a knock-down move!

Principles of Constitutional Construction

Constitutional interpretation, or constitutional construction, the term more
often used by the Founders, is the process by which meanings are assigned to
words in a constitution, to enable legal decisions to be made that are justified
by it. Some scholars distinguish between "interpretation" â€” assigning meanings
based on the meanings in other usages of the terms by those the writers and
their readers had probably read, and "construction" â€” inferring the meaning from
a broader set of evidence, such as the structure of the complete document from
which one can discern the function of various parts, discussion by the drafters
or ratifiers during debate leading to adoption ("legislative history"), the
background of controversies in which the terms were used that indicate the
concerns and expectations of the drafters and ratifiers, alternative wordings
and their meanings accepted or rejected at different points in development, and
indications of meanings that can be inferred from what is not said, among other
methods of analysis.

There is also a question of whether the meanings should be taken from the public
meanings shared among the literate populace, the private meanings used among the
drafters and ratifiers that might not have been widely shared, or the public
legal meanings of terms that were best known by more advanced legal scholars of
the time. Most of the U.S. Constitution appears to have been written to be
understood by ordinary people of that era, although people then were much more
literate in the law than people are now. However, many of its words and phrases
are fairly deep legal terms that were only well understood by a few of the
legally educated Founders, even though the general population probably had a
rudimentary understanding of them.

There is a problem with the "original public meaning" formulation, because while the meanings of constitutional terms were "public" in the sense that they were not "private" or "secret", they were not necessarily familiar to ordinary people of the era. More accurate would be "legally educated and still learning public meaning", because many of the Founders themselves used terms that they had to research to find the meanings of. An example of this can be seen in the comments by Dickenson in the Federal Convention Aug. 29, 1787, about ex post facto only applying to criminal cases, after researching the topic in Blackstone's Commentaries. So since we can presume the Founders mostly agreed on the writers they considered authoritative on legal usages, we can reasonably refer to the writings of those other writers to find the meanings the Founders intended even if the Founders themselves had not yet done the research to fully master the concepts.

For constitutional terms the denotata are not empirical objects so much as ideas, that is, mental models, that do not, for the most part, have the advantage of some formal scientific models of being representable in mathematical or computer formalisms that we can examine externally. In particular, they are ideas that existed in the minds of persons long dead, so we have to develop mental models of their mental models ("theory of mind") based on the things they read and wrote. That can be done. The verification comes with being able to predict what one of them will say in a writing one hasn't read yet. Becoming adept at doing so can reassure one that one has "gotten into their heads". But that is not something one can demonstrate to others.

This leads to the admonition that the English used in the Constitution and other
legal documents of the 18th century should be read as a foreign language,
putting aside today's meanings of what seem to be the same words we use today,
and attempting to decode the meanings from various clues we can find. This is
not only wise for 18th century English, but for almost any communications, even
among people who communicate with one another daily, because no two people mean
precisely the same thing by the same words on every occasion. When both speaker
and listener are alive they are able to interrogate one another to arrive at a
common meaning, but when the author is dead we have to find evidence in other
things he or his correspondents wrote.

Constitutional controversies are about whether an official act is consistent with, and authorized by, a constitution or constitutional statute or court decision. Since a constitution is a law, and the supreme law within its domain, and authorizes statutes and other official acts which have a textual expression, the principles of constitutional interpretation are essentially the same as the principles of statutory or judicial interpretation.

Most legal scholars recognize seven main methods of judicial decisionmaking:
textual, historical, functional, doctrinal, prudential, equitable,
and natural, although they may differ on what each includes, and
there is some overlap among them.

   1. Textual. Decision based on the actual words of the written
     law, if the meaning of the words is unambiguous. Since a law is
     a command, then it must mean what it meant to the lawgiver,
     and if the meaning of the words used in it have changed since it
     was issued, then textual analysis must be of the words as
     understood by the lawgiver, which for a constitution would be
     the understanding of the ratifying convention or, if that is
     unclear, of the drafters. Some Latin maxims: A verbis legis
     non est recedendum. From the words of the law there is not
     any departure. 5 Coke 118. Noscitur ï¿½sociis. Meaning of
     words may be ascertained by associated words. 3 T.R. 87.

   2. Historical. Decision based less on the actual words than on
     the understanding revealed by analysis of the history of the
     drafting and ratification of the law, for constitutions and
     statutes, sometimes called its legislative history, and for judicial
     edicts, the case history. A textual analysis for words whose
     meanings have changed therefore overlaps historical analysis.
     It arises out of such Latin maxims as Animus hominis est
     anima scripti. Intention is the soul of an instrument. 3 Bulst.
     67.

   3. Functional. Also called structural. Decision based on
     analysis of the structures the law constituted and how they are
     apparently intended to function as a coherent, harmonious
     system. A Latin maxim is Nemo aliquam partem recte
     intelligere potest antequam totum perlegit. No one can
     properly understand a part until he has read the whole. 3 Coke
     Rep. 59.

   4. Doctrinal. Decision based on prevailing practices or opinions
     of legal professionals, mainly legislative, executive, or judicial
     precedents, according to the meta-doctrine of stare decisis,
     which treats the principles according to which court decisions
     have been made as not merely advisory but as normative.
     Some Latin maxims are: Argumentum ï¿½simili valet in lege.
     An argument from a like case avails in law. Coke, Littleton,
     191. Consuetudo et communis assuetudo ... interpretatur
     legem scriptam, si lex sit generalis. Custom and common
     usage ... interpret the written law, if it be general. Jenk. Cent.
     273. Cursus curiï¿½est lex curiï¿½ The practice of the court is
     the law of the court. 3 Buls. 53. Judiciis posterioribus fides
     est adhibenda. Credit is to be given to the latest decisions. 13
     Coke 14. Res judicata pro veritate accipitur. A thing
     adjudicated is received as true. Coke, Littleton, 103.

   5. Prudential. Decision based on factors external to the law or
     interests of the parties in the case, such as the convenience of
     overburdened officials, efficiency of governmental operations,
     avoidance of stimulating more cases, or response to political
     pressure. One such consideration, avoidance of disturbing a
     stable body of practices, is also the main motivation for the
     doctrinal method. It also includes such considerations as
     whether a case is "ripe" for decision, or whether lesser or
     administrative remedies have first been exhausted. A Latin
     maxim is Boni judicis est lites dirimere. The duty of a good
     judge is to prevent litigation. 4 Coke 15.

   6. Equitable. Also called ethical. Decision based on an innate
     sense of justice, balancing the interests of the parties, and what
     is right and wrong, regardless of what the written law might
     provide. Often resorted to in cases in which the facts were not
     adequately anticipated or provided for by the lawgivers. Some
     scholars put various balancing tests of interests and values in
     the prudential category, but it works better to distinguish
     between prudential as balancing the interests and values of
     the legal system from equitable as balancing the interests and
     values of the parties. It arises out of the Latin maxim, ï¿½uitas
     est perfecta quï¿½am ratio quï¿½jus scriptum interpretatur
     et emendat; nulla scriptura comprehensa, sed sola ratione
     consistens. Equity is a sort of perfect reason which interprets
     and amends written law; comprehended in no code, but
     consistent with reason alone. Coke, Littleton, 24.

   7. Natural. Decision based on what is required or advised by
     the laws of nature, or perhaps of human nature, and on what is
     physically or economically possible or practical, or on what is
     actually likely to occur. This has its origin in such ancient Latin
     maxims as: Jura naturï¿½sunt immutabilia. The laws of
     nature are unchangeable. Jacob. 63. Impossibilium nulla
     obligatio est. There is no obligation to do impossible things.
     D. 50, 17, 185. Lex non cogit ad impossibilia. The law does
     not compel the impossible. Hob. 96. Lex neminem cogit ad
     vana seu inutilia peragenda. The law requires no one to do
     vain or useless things. 5 Coke 21. Legibus sumptis
     desinentibus, lege naturï¿½utendum est. Laws of the state
     failing, we must act by the law of nature. 2 Rol. Rep. 98. 

Of these, only the first three, textual, historical, and functional, are methods
of interpreting or constructing the written constitution of government, and the
historical and functional methods may be more a matter of construction than
interpretation. The last, natural, is construction (not interpretation) of the
unwritten constitution of nature, or the unwritten constitution of society,
which form a hierarchy of authority, with the constitution of nature superior to
the constitution of society, and the constitution of society superior to the
written constitution of government. The doctrinal, prudential, and equitable
methods are not interpretion or construction of any of these constitutions,
although judges often claim they are. There is an misguided tendency among
modern judges to misrepresent what are essentially prudential or equitable
decisions as constitutional constructions. Too many lawyers are complicit in
this by casting what are essentially prudential or equitable arguments into
constitutional terms. There is nothing inherently wrong with making prudential
or equitable decisions. The U.S. Constitution confers both law and equity
jurisdictions on federal courts, as do the state constitutions. The problem
comes with treating such decisions as establishing precedents, especially
binding ones. It is one thing to treat a decision as a precedent that clarifies
some ambiguity in the constitution, but quite another to essentially insert a
prudential or equitable decision into the constitution as a kind of amendment.
Such decisions must not conflict with constitutions or constitutional statutes,
but often do. Doctrinal and prudential decisions are more troublesome. The
doctrinal method may be compatible with the written constitution of government
if it merely involves clarifications of ambiguities in the original text, but
not when those doctrines depart from original legal understanding, as they
sometimes do.[1] The prudential method may be justifiable as necessary to handle
large caseloads, but often neglect to render justice in particular cases,
especially when they involve avoidance of controversy rather than a desire to
settle all issues brought before the court.

Within these methods, we can, by study of the writings of the
Founders, and the writings they read, elicit such principles for
interpreting or constructing the Constitution for the United States as the following:

   1. The Constitution is the written document. Although it may
     be considered to include the understandings of its words as of
     the time of ratification, it does not include the subsequent body
     of practices or precedents upon which constitutional decisions
     might be based, which may or may not be consistent with it, or
     authorized by it. The written document refers to itself as "this
     Constitution", and provides for only four methods by which it
     may be amended, all of which apply only to the written
     document.

   2. The authority for provisions of the Constitution is the
     ratifications and state admissions. Current consent or
     acquiescence, or lack thereof, to the Constitution or any
     practice, does not affect the original constitutive acts, and has
     no authority, unless expressed through adoption of
     amendments as provided in Article V.

   3. Provisions of the Constitution are mutually consistent.
     There are no internal logical contradictions, except that a 
     provision of an amendment inconsistent with a previous 
     provision supersedes that provision.

   4. None of the words are without force and effect, except those 
     superseded by amendments, unless such amendments are repealed. 
     Except for the statement of purpose in the preamble, every word was
     intended by the Framers to be legally normative, and not just
     advisory, declaratory, aspirational, or exhortatory. Verba intelligi 
     ut aliquid operantur debent. Words should be interpreted to give 
     them some effect.

   5. Rights and powers are complementary. Every right
     recognized by the Constitution is an immunity, that is, a right
     against a positive action by government, and is equivalent to a
     restriction on delegated powers. Conversely, every delegated
     power is a restriction on immunities. An immunity may be
     expressed either as a declaration of the right, or as a restriction
     on powers.

   6. There are no redundancies within the original
     unamended Constitution. However, amendments may be
     alternative ways of expressing equivalent content in the original
     unamended Constitution or previous amendments. More
     specifically, the Bill of Rights added no new content not
     implicit in the original unamended Constitution, except the
     twenty dollar rule of the Seventh Amendment.

   7. The Constitution was intended to define a functionally
     complete and harmonious system. That does not mean,
     however, that all powers anyone might think the nation or any
     branch, level, office or department should have, were actually
     delegated.

   8. Original "intent" is functional, not motivational. The
     private motives of the Framers or Founders are irrelevant and
     largely unknowable, and likely to have been diverse. The
     common law rule of interpretation understood by the Founders
     was to discern the functional role of elements of the law, not
     the private purposes of the lawgivers.

   9. The ratification debates are the best evidence of
     original understanding. The arguments of those opposed to
     ratification are not just the positions of the losers in the
     debates, which some might dismiss as not indicative of original
     understanding. As the debates proceeded, understandings
     evolved and clarified, and positions changed. Most opponents
     were satisfied by adoption of a Bill of Rights, and by
     assurances by the proponents concerning how the words of
     the Constitution would be interpreted, and those assurances
     must be considered part of the original understanding. That
     means that a construction to which the more significant
     "anti-federalists" would object is almost certainly incorrect.

  10. Powers are narrow, rights broad. The entire theme and
     tenor of the ratification debates was that delegated powers
     were to be interpreted as strictly as possible, consistent with
     the words, and rights as broadly as possible, with the
     presumption in favor of the right, and the burden of proof on
     those claiming a power. Potestas stricte interpretatur. A
     power is strictly interpreted. In dubiis, non prï¿½umitur pro
     potentia. In cases of doubt, the presumption is not in favor of
     a power.

  11. Delegated powers cannot be subdelegated. The U.S.
     Constitution vests all legislative powers in Congress, and all
     judicial powers in the Supreme Court and inferior courts,
     except as specifically expressed. Executive branch officials
     may subdelegate but must remain responsible for the actions of
     their subordinates. There can be no authority exercised that is
     not accountable through constitutional officials.Delegata
     potestas non potest delegari. A delegated power cannot be
     delegated. 9 Inst. 597.

  12. The power to regulate is not the power to prohibit all
     modalities of something. It is only the power to issue
     prescriptions to "make regular", enforceable only by
     deprivations of property or privileges, not of life, limb, or
     liberty. There must always be some modality that is not
     prohibited.

  13. Implied powers are only to "carry into Execution" an
     expressed power and not to do whatever is necessary to
     achieve the intent for which a power might be exercised.
     Delegation of a power is delegation of the right to make a
     certain kind of effort, not to do whatever is necessary to get a
     desired outcome.

  14. There can be no common law crimes. They are in conflict
     with the prohibitions on ex post facto laws and bills of
     attainder.

  15. Rights may not be disabled or unduly burdened by
     legislative or executive process. "Due" process is judicial
     only, involving the granting of a petition to disable a right of the
     defendant, with the burden of proof on the plaintiff or
     prosecutor, and with the defendant having at least those
     minimum protections that prevailed during the Founding. with
     similar disablements having similar standards of proof and
     protection.

  16. There is no right without a remedy. Ubi jus ibi
     remedium. There must always be an accessible forum in
     which a complainant has oyer and terminer for any petition. 

  17.  The Founders were learning. "Original meaning" is not just about what the Founders consciously meant at the moment of ratification, but includes what they would discover with further study of the legal tradition they invoked in the words they chose. Thus, they referred to authors like Blackstone and Coke when they were unsure what they meant, and so must we.

  18.  Early practice indicative but not dispositive. Early practice by the Founders may provide evidence of their aspirations in the words they chose, but should not be regarded as perfect expressions of their intent. Practice can represent compromise with practical concerns and may lag behind the ideals contained in the words.

  19.Â Mental models of mental models. Each of us has a mental model of the world that includes a model of the mental models others have of the world. Communication is possible only to the extent that our mental models of the mental models of others are somehow accurate or congruent. When a lawgiver issues a law, a command to others for future compliance, he is relying on others to understand his words the way he does, and those others are relying on him to use words with the meanings they have for them. But words are an imperfect way to convey meanings, and if the recipient of the command cannot interrogate the lawgiver for his meaning, he must try to improve his mental model of the lawgiver's mental model by such means as learning to accurately predict what the lawgiver will write about matters the recipient has not previously read.

  20.Â Find the right level of abstraction. It was common for the Founders to use somewhat more concrete words to mean broader principles. Thus, "press" or "arms" is not limited to the technology of the time, but refers to the general function they served. "Militia" does not mean merely those legally obliged to respond to an official call-up, but defense activity generally.

A more complete discussion of these principles is best done by
reference to Landmark Court Decisions.

This document is a brief introduction to TCP/IP, followed by advice on
what to read for more information.  This  is  not  intended  to  be  a
complete  description.    It  can  give  you  a reasonable idea of the
capabilities of the protocols.  But if you need to know any details of
the  technology,  you  will  want  to  read  the  standards  yourself.
Throughout the text, you will find references to the standards, in the
form of "RFC" or "IEN" numbers.  These are document numbers. The final
section of this  document  tells  you  how  to  get  copies  of  those
standards.



1. What is TCP/IP?


TCP/IP  is a set of protocols developed to allow cooperating computers
to share resources across a network.  It was developed by a  community
of  researchers centered around the ARPAnet.  Certainly the ARPAnet is
the best-known TCP/IP network.  However as of June, 87, at  least  130
different  vendors  had products that support TCP/IP, and thousands of
networks of all kinds use it.

First some basic definitions.  The most accurate name for the  set  of
protocols we are describing is the "Internet protocol suite".  TCP and
IP are two of the protocols in this suite.  (They  will  be  described
below.)    Because  TCP and IP are the best known of the protocols, it
has become common to use the term TCP/IP or IP/TCP  to  refer  to  the
whole  family.  It is probably not worth fighting this habit.  However
this can lead to some oddities.  For example, I  find  myself  talking
about  NFS as being based on TCP/IP, even though it doesn't use TCP at
all.  (It does use IP.  But it  uses  an  alternative  protocol,  UDP,
instead  of TCP.  All of this alphabet soup will be unscrambled in the
following pages.)

The Internet is a  collection  of  networks,  including  the  Arpanet,
NSFnet, regional networks such as NYsernet, local networks at a number
of University and research institutions,  and  a  number  of  military
networks.  The term "Internet" applies to this entire set of networks.
The subset of them that is managed by the  Department  of  Defense  is
referred  to  as the "DDN" (Defense Data Network).  This includes some
research-oriented networks, such as  the  Arpanet,  as  well  as  more
strictly  military  ones.    (Because much of the funding for Internet
protocol developments is done via  the  DDN  organization,  the  terms
Internet  and  DDN  can  sometimes  seem  equivalent.)    All of these
networks are connected to each other.  Users can  send  messages  from
any  of  them  to  any other, except where there are security or other
policy restrictions on access.    Officially  speaking,  the  Internet
protocol  documents  are  simply  standards  adopted  by  the Internet
community for its own use.  More recently, the Department  of  Defense
issued a MILSPEC definition of TCP/IP.  This was intended to be a more
formal definition, appropriate for use in  purchasing  specifications.
However  most  of  the  TCP/IP community continues to use the Internet
standards.  The MILSPEC version is intended to be consistent with it.

Whatever it is called, TCP/IP is a family of protocols.  A few provide
                                  1
 


"low-level" functions needed for many applications.  These include IP,
TCP, and UDP.  (These will be described in a bit more  detail  later.)
Others are protocols for doing specific tasks, e.g. transferring files
between computers, sending mail, or finding out who is  logged  in  on
another   computer.      Initially  TCP/IP  was  used  mostly  between
minicomputers or mainframes.  These machines had their own disks,  and
generally  were self-contained.  Thus the most important "traditional"
TCP/IP services are:

   - file transfer.  The file transfer protocol (FTP) allows a user on
     any computer to get files from another computer, or to send files
     to another computer.  Security is handled by requiring  the  user
     to  specify  a  user  name  and  password for the other computer.
     Provisions are made for handling file transfer  between  machines
     with different character set, end of line conventions, etc.  This
     is not quite the same thing as more recent "network file  system"
     or  "netbios"  protocols, which will be described below.  Rather,
     FTP is a utility that you run any time you want to access a  file
     on  another  system.    You  use  it to copy the file to your own
     system.  You then work with the local copy.   (See  RFC  959  for
     specifications for FTP.)

   - remote  login.    The network terminal protocol (TELNET) allows a
     user to log in on any other computer on the network.  You start a
     remote session by specifying a computer to connect to.  From that
     time until you finish the session, anything you type is  sent  to
     the  other  computer.   Note that you are really still talking to
     your own computer.  But the telnet program effectively makes your
     computer invisible while it is running.  Every character you type
     is sent directly to the other system.  Generally, the  connection
     to  the  remote  computer  behaves much like a dialup connection.
     That is, the remote system will ask you to  log  in  and  give  a
     password, in whatever manner it would normally ask a user who had
     just dialed it up.  When you log off of the other  computer,  the
     telnet  program exits, and you will find yourself talking to your
     own computer.  Microcomputer implementations of telnet  generally
     include  a  terminal  emulator  for some common type of terminal.
     (See RFC's 854 and 855 for specifications for  telnet.    By  the
     way,  the  telnet protocol should not be confused with Telenet, a
     vendor of commercial network services.)

   - computer mail.  This allows you to  send  messages  to  users  on
     other  computers.    Originally, people tended to use only one or
     two specific computers.  They  would  maintain  "mail  files"  on
     those machines.  The computer mail system is simply a way for you
     to add a message to another user's mail file.    There  are  some
     problems  with  this  in  an environment where microcomputers are
     used.  The most serious is that a micro is  not  well  suited  to
     receive  computer  mail.    When you send mail, the mail software
     expects to be able  to  open  a  connection  to  the  addressee's
     computer, in order to send the mail.  If this is a microcomputer,
     it may be turned off, or it may be running an  application  other
     than  the mail system.  For this reason, mail is normally handled
     by a larger system, where it is practical to have a  mail  server
     running all the time.  Microcomputer mail software then becomes a
                                  2
 


     user interface that retrieves mail from the mail  server.    (See
     RFC  821  and  822 for specifications for computer mail.  See RFC
     937 for a protocol designed for microcomputers to use in  reading
     mail from a mail server.)

These  services  should  be  present  in any implementation of TCP/IP,
except that micro-oriented implementations may  not  support  computer
mail.  These traditional applications still play a very important role
in TCP/IP-based networks.  However more recently,  the  way  in  which
networks  are  used has been changing.  The older model of a number of
large, self-sufficient computers is beginning to  change.    Now  many
installations    have    several   kinds   of   computers,   including
microcomputers, workstations, minicomputers, and  mainframes.    These
computers  are  likely  to be configured to perform specialized tasks.
Although people are still likely to work with one  specific  computer,
that  computer  will  call on other systems on the net for specialized
services.  This has  led  to  the  "server/client"  model  of  network
services.    A server is a system that provides a specific service for
the rest of the network.  A client is another system  that  uses  that
service.    (Note  that the server and client need not be on different
computers.  They could be  different  programs  running  on  the  same
computer.)    Here  are  the  kinds  of servers typically present in a
modern computer setup.  Note that these computer services can  all  be
provided within the framework of TCP/IP.

   - network  file  systems.   This allows a system to access files on
     another computer in a somewhat more  closely  integrated  fashion
     than FTP.  A network file system provides the illusion that disks
     or other devices from one system are directly connected to  other
     systems.    There  is no need to use a special network utility to
     access a file on another system.  Your computer simply thinks  it
     has  some  extra disk drives.  These extra "virtual" drives refer
     to the other system's disks.    This  capability  is  useful  for
     several different purposes.  It lets you put large disks on a few
     computers, but still give others access to the disk space.  Aside
     from the obvious economic benefits, this allows people working on
     several computers  to  share  common  files.    It  makes  system
     maintenance  and  backup  easier, because you don't have to worry
     about updating  and  backing  up  copies  on  lots  of  different
     machines.    A  number  of  vendors  now  offer  high-performance
     diskless computers.  These computers have no disk drives at  all.
     They  are  entirely dependent upon disks attached to common "file
     servers".   (See  RFC's  1001  and  1002  for  a  description  of
     PC-oriented   NetBIOS   over   TCP.     In  the  workstation  and
     minicomputer area, Sun's Network File System is more likely to be
     used.    Protocol  specifications  for  it are available from Sun
     Microsystems.)

   - remote printing.  This allows you to  access  printers  on  other
     computers  as if they were directly attached to yours.  (The most
     commonly used protocol is the remote  lineprinter  protocol  from
     Berkeley  Unix.  Unfortunately, there is no protocol document for
     this.  However the C code is easily obtained  from  Berkeley,  so
     implementations are common.)

                                  3
 


   - remote  execution.   This allows you to request that a particular
     program be run on a different computer.  This is useful when  you
     can  do  most  of  your work on a small computer, but a few tasks
     require the resources of a larger system.  There are a number  of
     different  kinds  of remote execution.  Some operate on a command
     by command basis.  That is, you request that a  specific  command
     or  set  of commands should run on some specific computer.  (More
     sophisticated versions will choose a system that  happens  to  be
     free.)    However  there are also "remote procedure call" systems
     that allow a program to  call  a  subroutine  that  will  run  on
     another  computer.    (There  are  many  protocols  of this sort.
     Berkeley Unix contains two servers to execute commands  remotely:
     rsh  and  rexec.   The man pages describe the protocols that they
     use.  The user-contributed software with Berkeley 4.3 contains  a
     "distributed  shell"  that  will  distribute tasks among a set of
     systems, depending upon load.  Remote procedure  call  mechanisms
     have  been  a  topic  for research for a number of years, so many
     organizations have implementations of such facilities.  The  most
     widespread commercially-supported remote procedure call protocols
     seem to be Xerox's Courier and Sun's RPC.  Protocol documents are
     available  from  Xerox and Sun.  There is a public implementation
     of Courier over TCP as part of the user-contributed software with
     Berkeley  4.3.   An implementation of RPC was posted to Usenet by
     Sun, and also appears as part of  the  user-contributed  software
     with Berkeley 4.3.)

   - name  servers.    In  large  installations, there are a number of
     different collections of names that have to  be  managed.    This
     includes  users  and their passwords, names and network addresses
     for computers, and accounts.  It becomes  very  tedious  to  keep
     this data up to date on all of the computers.  Thus the databases
     are kept on a small number of systems.  Other systems access  the
     data over the network.  (RFC 822 and 823 describe the name server
     protocol used to keep track of host names and Internet  addresses
     on  the  Internet.    This  is  now a required part of any TCP/IP
     implementation.  IEN 116 describes an older name server  protocol
     that is used by a few terminal servers and other products to look
     up host names.  Sun's  Yellow  Pages  system  is  designed  as  a
     general  mechanism to handle user names, file sharing groups, and
     other databases commonly used by Unix  systems.    It  is  widely
     available  commercially.    Its  protocol definition is available
     from Sun.)

   - terminal servers.  Many installations no longer connect terminals
     directly  to  computers.    Instead they connect them to terminal
     servers.  A terminal server is simply a small computer that  only
     knows  how  to  run  telnet  (or some other protocol to do remote
     login).  If your terminal is  connected  to  one  of  these,  you
     simply  type the name of a computer, and you are connected to it.
     Generally it is possible to have active connections to more  than
     one  computer  at  the  same time.  The terminal server will have
     provisions to switch between connections rapidly, and  to  notify
     you  when  output  is  waiting for another connection.  (Terminal
     servers use the telnet protocol, already mentioned.  However  any
     real terminal server will also have to support name service and a
                                  4
 


     number of other protocols.)

   - network-oriented  window  systems.      Until   recently,   high-
     performance  graphics  programs had to execute on a computer that
     had  a  bit-mapped  graphics  screen  directly  attached  to  it.
     Network  window  systems  allow  a  program to use a display on a
     different computer.  Full-scale network window systems provide an
     interface  that  lets you distribute jobs to the systems that are
     best  suited  to  handle  them,  but  still  give  you  a  single
     graphically-based  user  interface.  (The most widely-implemented
     window system is X. A  protocol  description  is  available  from
     MIT's  Project  Athena.  A reference implementation is publically
     available from MIT.  A number  of  vendors  are  also  supporting
     NeWS,  a window system defined by Sun.  Both of these systems are
     designed to use TCP/IP.)

Note that some of the  protocols  described  above  were  designed  by
Berkeley,  Sun,  or other organizations.  Thus they are not officially
part of the Internet protocol suite.   However  they  are  implemented
using  TCP/IP, just as normal TCP/IP application protocols are.  Since
the protocol definitions are not  considered  proprietary,  and  since
commercially-support  implementations  are  widely  available,  it  is
reasonable to think of these protocols as being  effectively  part  of
the  Internet  suite.   Note that the list above is simply a sample of
the sort of services  available  through  TCP/IP.    However  it  does
contain   the  majority  of  the  "major"  applications.    The  other
commonly-used protocols tend to be specialized facilities for  getting
information  of  various  kinds, such as who is logged in, the time of
day, etc.  However if you need a facility that is not listed here,  we
encourage  you  to  look  through  the  current  edition  of  Internet
Protocols (currently RFC 1011),  which  lists  all  of  the  available
protocols,   and   also   to   look   at  some  of  the  major  TCP/IP
implementations to see what various vendors have added.



2. General description of the TCP/IP protocols


TCP/IP is a layered set of protocols.  In  order  to  understand  what
this  means,  it is useful to look at an example.  A typical situation
is sending mail.  First, there is a protocol for mail.  This defines a
set  of  commands which one machine sends to another, e.g. commands to
specify who the sender of the message is, who it is being sent to, and
then  the  text  of  the  message.  However this protocol assumes that
there is a way to communicate  reliably  between  the  two  computers.
Mail,  like  other  application  protocols,  simply  defines  a set of
commands and messages to be sent.  It is designed to be used  together
with  TCP and IP. TCP is responsible for making sure that the commands
get through to the other end.  It keeps track of  what  is  sent,  and
retransmitts anything that did not get through.  If any message is too
large for one datagram, e.g. the text of the mail, TCP will  split  it
up  into  several  datagrams,  and  make  sure  that  they  all arrive
correctly.  Since these functions are needed  for  many  applications,
they are put together into a separate protocol, rather than being part
                                  5
 


of the specifications for sending mail.   You  can  think  of  TCP  as
forming a library of routines that applications can use when they need
reliable network communications with another computer.  Similarly, TCP
calls  on the services of IP.  Although the services that TCP supplies
are needed by  many  applications,  there  are  still  some  kinds  of
applications  that  don't  need them.  However there are some services
that every application needs.  So these services are put together into
IP.    As  with TCP, you can think of IP as a library of routines that
TCP calls on, but which is also available to applications  that  don't
use  TCP.    This  strategy  of building several levels of protocol is
called "layering".  We think of  the  applications  programs  such  as
mail,  TCP, and IP, as being separate "layers", each of which calls on
the services of the layer below it.   Generally,  TCP/IP  applications
use 4 layers:

   - an application protocol such as mail

   - a  protocol  such  as  TCP  that  provides  services need by many
     applications

   - IP, which provides the basic  service  of  getting  datagrams  to
     their destination

   - the  protocols  needed to manage a specific physical medium, such
     as Ethernet or a point to point line.

TCP/IP is based on the "catenet model".  (This is  described  in  more
detail  in  IEN 48.)  This model assumes that there are a large number
of independent networks connected together  by  gateways.    The  user
should  be able to access computers or other resources on any of these
networks.   Datagrams  will  often  pass  through  a  dozen  different
networks  before  getting  to  their  final  destination.  The routing
needed to accomplish this should be completely invisible to the  user.
As  far  as  the  user  is concerned, all he needs to know in order to
access another system is an "Internet address".  This  is  an  address
that looks like 128.6.4.194.  It is actually a 32-bit number.  However
it is normally written as 4 decimal numbers, each representing 8  bits
of  the  address.  (The term "octet" is used by Internet documentation
for such 8-bit chunks.  The term "byte" is not used, because TCP/IP is
supported  by  some computers that have byte sizes other than 8 bits.)
Generally the structure of the  address  gives  you  some  information
about  how  to  get  to  the  system.  For example, 128.6 is a network
number assigned by a central authority to Rutgers University.  Rutgers
uses  the  next  octet  to  indicate  which of the campus Ethernets is
involved.  128.6.4 happens to be an  Ethernet  used  by  the  Computer
Science  Department.    The last octet allows for up to 254 systems on
each Ethernet.  (It is 254 because 0 and  255  are  not  allowed,  for
reasons  that  will  be  discussed  later.)  Note that 128.6.4.194 and
128.6.5.194 would be different systems.  The structure of an  Internet
address is described in a bit more detail later.

Of  course  we  normally  refer  to  systems  by  name, rather than by
Internet address.  When we specify a name, the network software  looks
it  up  in  a  database,  and comes up with the corresponding Internet
address.  Most of the network software deals strictly in terms of  the
                                  6
 


address.  (RFC 882 describes the name server technology used to handle
this lookup.)

TCP/IP is  built  on  "connectionless"  technology.    Information  is
transfered  as  a sequence of "datagrams".  A datagram is a collection
of data that is sent as a single message.  Each of these datagrams  is
sent  through  the network individually.  There are provisions to open
connections (i.e.  to start a conversation that will continue for some
time).    However at some level, information from those connections is
broken up into datagrams, and  those  datagrams  are  treated  by  the
network  as  completely  separate.    For example, suppose you want to
transfer a 15000 octet file.  Most networks can't handle a 15000 octet
datagram.   So the protocols will break this up into something like 30
500-octet datagrams.  Each of these datagrams  will  be  sent  to  the
other  end.    At  that point, they will be put back together into the
15000-octet file.  However while those datagrams are in  transit,  the
network doesn't know that there is any connection between them.  It is
perfectly possible  that  datagram  14  will  actually  arrive  before
datagram  13.    It is also possible that somewhere in the network, an
error will occur, and some datagram won't get through at all.  In that
case, that datagram has to be sent again.

Note  by  the way that the terms "datagram" and "packet" often seem to
be nearly interchangable.  Technically, datagram is the right word  to
use  when  describing  TCP/IP.  A datagram is a unit of data, which is
what the protocols deal with.  A packet is a physical thing, appearing
on an Ethernet or some wire.  In most cases a packet simply contains a
datagram, so there is  very  little  difference.    However  they  can
differ.  When TCP/IP is used on top of X.25, the X.25 interface breaks
the datagrams up into 128-byte packets.   This  is  invisible  to  IP,
because  the  packets  are put back together into a single datagram at
the other end before being processed by TCP/IP.  So in this case,  one
IP  datagram  would  be carried by several packets.  However with most
media, there are efficiency advantages to  sending  one  datagram  per
packet, and so the distinction tends to vanish.



2.1 The TCP level


Two separate protocols are involved in handling TCP/IP datagrams.  TCP
(the "transmission control protocol") is responsible for  breaking  up
the  message  into  datagrams,  reassembling  them  at  the other end,
resending anything that gets lost, and  putting  things  back  in  the
right  order.  IP (the "internet protocol") is responsible for routing
individual datagrams.  It may seem like TCP is  doing  all  the  work.
And  in  small networks that is true.  However in the Internet, simply
getting a datagram to its  destination  can  be  a  complex  job.    A
connection  may require the datagram to go through several networks at
Rutgers, a serial line to the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center,  a
couple  of Ethernets there, a series of 56Kbaud phone lines to another
NSFnet site, and more Ethernets on another campus.  Keeping  track  of
the  routes  to all of the destinations and handling incompatibilities
among different transport media turns out to be a complex job.    Note
                                  7
 


that  the  interface  between TCP and IP is fairly simple.  TCP simply
hands IP a datagram with a destination.   IP  doesn't  know  how  this
datagram relates to any datagram before it or after it.

It  may  have occurred to you that something is missing here.  We have
talked about Internet addresses, but not about how you keep  track  of
multiple  connections  to  a given system.  Clearly it isn't enough to
get a datagram to the right  destination.    TCP  has  to  know  which
connection  this  datagram  is  part  of.  This task is referred to as
"demultiplexing."  In fact, there are several levels of demultiplexing
going  on in TCP/IP.  The information needed to do this demultiplexing
is contained in a series of "headers".  A header is simply a few extra
octets  tacked  onto  the  beginning of a datagram by some protocol in
order to keep track of it.  It's a lot like putting a letter  into  an
envelope  and  putting  an  address  on  the  outside of the envelope.
Except with modern networks it happens several times.  It's  like  you
put the letter into a little envelope, your secretary puts that into a
somewhat bigger envelope, the campus mail center  puts  that  envelope
into a still bigger one, etc.  Here is an overview of the headers that
get stuck on a message that passes through a typical TCP/IP network:

We start with a single data stream, say a file you are trying to  send
to some other computer:

   ......................................................

TCP  breaks  it  up into manageable chunks.  (In order to do this, TCP
has to know how large a datagram your network can handle.    Actually,
the TCP's at each end say how big a datagram they can handle, and then
they pick the smallest size.)

   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....   ....

TCP puts a header at the front of each datagram.  This header actually
contains  at least 20 octets, but the most important ones are a source
and destination "port number" and  a  "sequence  number".    The  port
numbers  are used to keep track of different conversations.  Suppose 3
different people are transferring files.  Your TCP might allocate port
numbers 1000, 1001, and 1002 to these transfers.  When you are sending
a datagram, this becomes the "source" port number, since you  are  the
source  of  the  datagram.    Of  course  the TCP at the other end has
assigned a port number of its own for the conversation.  Your TCP  has
to  know the port number used by the other end as well.  (It finds out
when the connection starts, as we will explain below.)  It  puts  this
in  the  "destination" port field.  Of course if the other end sends a
datagram back to you, the source and destination port numbers will  be
reversed,  since  then  it  will  be  the  source  and you will be the
destination.  Each datagram has a sequence number.  This  is  used  so
that  the  other  end  can make sure that it gets the datagrams in the
right  order,  and  that  it  hasn't  missed  any.    (See   the   TCP
specification for details.)  TCP doesn't number the datagrams, but the
octets.  So if there are 500 octets of  data  in  each  datagram,  the
first datagram might be numbered 0, the second 500, the next 1000, the
next 1500, etc.  Finally, I will mention the  Checksum.    This  is  a
number  that  is  computed by adding up all the octets in the datagram
                                  8
 


(more or less - see the TCP spec).  The result is put in  the  header.
TCP  at  the other end computes the checksum again.  If they disagree,
then something bad happened to the datagram in transmission, and it is
thrown away.  So here's what the datagram looks like now.

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |          Source Port          |       Destination Port        |

    |   ......                                                      |

If  we abbreviate the TCP header as "T", the whole file now looks like
this:

   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....   T....

You will note that there are items in  the  header  that  I  have  not
described  above.    They  are  generally  involved  with managing the
connection.  In order to make sure the datagram  has  arrived  at  its
destination,  the  recipient  has  to  send back an "acknowledgement".
This is a datagram whose "Acknowledgement number" field is filled  in.
For  example,  sending  a  packet  with  an  acknowledgement  of  1500
indicates that you have received all the data up to octet number 1500.
If  the  sender  doesn't  get  an  acknowledgement within a reasonable
amount of time, it sends the data  again.    The  window  is  used  to
control  how  much  data can be in transit at any one time.  It is not
practical to wait for each datagram to be acknowledged before  sending
the  next  one.    That would slow things down too much.  On the other
hand, you can't just keep sending, or a fast  computer  might  overrun
the  capacity  of  a slow one to absorb data.  Thus each end indicates
how much new data it is currently prepared to absorb  by  putting  the
number  of  octets  in  its  "Window" field.  As the computer receives
data, the amount of space left in its window decreases.  When it  goes
to  zero, the sender has to stop.  As the receiver processes the data,
it increases its window, indicating that it is ready  to  accept  more
data.  Often the same datagram can be used to acknowledge receipt of a
set of data and to give permission for  additional  new  data  (by  an
updated  window).  The "Urgent" field allows one end to tell the other
to skip ahead in its processing to a particular octet.  This is  often
useful  for  handling asynchronous events, for example when you type a
control character or other command that interrupts output.  The  other
fields are beyond the scope of this document.

2.2 The IP level


TCP  sends each of these datagrams to IP.  Of course it has to tell IP
the Internet address of the computer at the other end.  Note that this
is  all  IP  is concerned about.  It doesn't care about what is in the
datagram, or even in the TCP header.  IP's job is  simply  to  find  a
route for the datagram and get it to the other end.  In order to allow
gateways or other intermediate systems to  forward  the  datagram,  it
adds  its  own  header.  The main things in this header are the source
and destination Internet address (32-bit addresses, like 128.6.4.194),
the  protocol  number,  and  another  checksum.    The source Internet
address is simply the address of your machine.  (This is necessary  so
the  other  end  knows where the datagram came from.)  The destination
Internet address is the address  of  the  other  machine.    (This  is
necessary  so  any  gateways  in  the  middle  know where you want the
datagram to go.)  The protocol number tells IP at  the  other  end  to
send  the  datagram  to TCP.  Although most IP traffic uses TCP, there
are other protocols that can use IP, so you  have  to  tell  IP  which
protocol  to send the datagram to.  Finally, the checksum allows IP at
the other end to verify that the header  wasn't  damaged  in  transit.
Note  that TCP and IP have separate checksums.  IP needs to be able to
verify that the header didn't get damaged in transit, or it could send
a  message to the wrong place.  For reasons not worth discussing here,
it is both more efficient and safer to have  TCP  compute  a  separate
checksum  for  the  TCP  header  and  data.  Once IP has tacked on its
header, here's what the message looks like:

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |Version|  IHL  |Type of Service|          Total Length         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |         Identification        |Flags|      Fragment Offset    |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  Time to Live |    Protocol   |         Header Checksum       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                       Source Address                          |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                    Destination Address                        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  TCP header, then your data ......                            |
    |                                                               |

If we represent the IP header by an "I",  your  file  now  looks  like
this:

   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....   IT....

Again,  the  header contains some additional fields that have not been
discussed.  Most of them are beyond the scope of this document.    The
flags  and fragment offset are used to keep track of the pieces when a
datagram has to be split up.   This  can  happen  when  datagrams  are
forwarded through a network for which they are too big.  (This will be
discussed a bit more below.)  The time to live is  a  number  that  is
decremented  whenever  the  datagram passes through a system.  When it
goes to zero, the datagram is discarded.  This is done in case a  loop
                                  10
 


develops  in the system somehow.  Of course this should be impossible,
but  well-designed  networks  are  built  to  cope  with  "impossible"
conditions.

At this point, it's possible that no more headers are needed.  If your
computer happens to have a direct phone  line  connecting  it  to  the
destination  computer,  or  to  a  gateway,  it  may  simply  send the
datagrams out on the line (though likely a synchronous  protocol  such
as  HDLC  would be used, and it would add at least a few octets at the
beginning and end).



2.3 The Ethernet level


However most of our networks these days use Ethernet.  So now we  have
to  describe  Ethernet's headers.  Unfortunately, Ethernet has its own
addresses.  The people who designed Ethernet wanted to make sure  that
no  two  machines  would  end  up  with  the  same  Ethernet  address.
Furthermore, they  didn't  want  the  user  to  have  to  worry  about
assigning  addresses.    So  each  Ethernet  controller  comes with an
address builtin from the factory.  In order to  make  sure  that  they
would  never have to reuse addresses, the Ethernet designers allocated
48 bits for the Ethernet address.  People who make Ethernet  equipment
have  to  register  with  a  central  authority, to make sure that the
numbers they assign don't overlap any other manufacturer.  Ethernet is
a "broadcast medium".  That is, it is in effect like an old party line
telephone.  When you send a packet out on the Ethernet, every  machine
on  the  network sees the packet.  So something is needed to make sure
that the right machine gets it.  As you might guess, this involves the
Ethernet  header.    Every  Ethernet packet has a 14-octet header that
includes the source and destination Ethernet address, and a type code.
Each machine is supposed to pay attention only to packets with its own
Ethernet address in the destination field.  (It's  perfectly  possible
to  cheat,  which  is  one reason that Ethernet communications are not
terribly secure.)  Note  that  there  is  no  connection  between  the
Ethernet address and the Internet address.  Each machine has to have a
table of what Ethernet address corresponds to what  Internet  address.
(We  will  describe  how  this  table is constructed a bit later.)  In
addition to the addresses, the header contains a type code.  The  type
code is to allow for several different protocol families to be used on
the same network.  So you can use TCP/IP, DECnet, Xerox  NS,  etc.  at
the  same  time.   Each of them will put a different value in the type
field.  Finally,  there  is  a  checksum.    The  Ethernet  controller
computes a checksum of the entire packet.  When the other end receives
the packet, it recomputes the checksum, and throws the packet away  if
the  answer  disagrees  with the original.  The checksum is put on the
end of the packet, not in the header.  The final result is  that  your
message looks like this:





                                  11
 


    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       Ethernet destination address (first 32 bits)            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    | Ethernet dest (last 16 bits)  |Ethernet source (first 16 bits)|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |       Ethernet source address (last 32 bits)                  |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |        Type code              |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |  IP header, then TCP header, then your data                   |
    |                                                               |
        ...
    |                                                               |
    |   end of your data                                            |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |                       Ethernet Checksum                       |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

If  we  represent  the  Ethernet  header  with  "E",  and the Ethernet
checksum with "C", your file now looks like this:

   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C   EIT....C

When these packets are received by the other end, of  course  all  the
headers  are  removed.    The  Ethernet interface removes the Ethernet
header and the checksum.  It looks at the type code.  Since  the  type
code  is the one assigned to IP, the Ethernet device driver passes the
datagram up to IP.  IP removes the IP header.   It  looks  at  the  IP
protocol  field.    Since  the  protocol  type  is  TCP, it passes the
datagram up to TCP.  TCP now looks at the sequence number.    It  uses
the  sequence  numbers  and  other  information  to  combine  all  the
datagrams into the original file.

The ends our initial summary of TCP/IP.  There are still some  crucial
concepts we haven't gotten to, so we'll now go back and add details in
several areas.  (For detailed descriptions of the items discussed here
see,  RFC  793  for  TCP,  RFC  791  for IP, and RFC's 894 and 826 for
sending IP over Ethernet.)



3. Well-known sockets and the applications layer


So far, we have described how a stream  of  data  is  broken  up  into
datagrams,  sent  to another computer, and put back together.  However
something more is needed  in  order  to  accomplish  anything  useful.
There  has  to  be  a  way for you to open a connection to a specified
computer, log into it, tell it what file you  want,  and  control  the
transmission  of  the  file.   (If you have a different application in
mind, e.g. computer mail, some analogous protocol is needed.)  This is
done  by  "application  protocols".  The application protocols run "on
top" of TCP/IP.  That is, when they want to send a message, they  give
the  message  to  TCP.   TCP makes sure it gets delivered to the other
end.  Because TCP and IP take care of all the networking details,  the
                                  12
 


applications  protocols can treat a network connection as if it were a
simple byte stream, like a terminal or phone line.

Before going into more details about applications programs, we have to
describe how you find an application.  Suppose you want to send a file
to a computer whose Internet address  is  128.6.4.7.    To  start  the
process,  you  need  more than just the Internet address.  You have to
connect to the FTP server at the  other  end.    In  general,  network
programs  are  specialized  for a specific set of tasks.  Most systems
have separate programs  to  handle  file  transfers,  remote  terminal
logins, mail, etc.  When you connect to 128.6.4.7, you have to specify
that you want to talk to the FTP server.    This  is  done  by  having
"well-known  sockets"  for  each  server.    Recall that TCP uses port
numbers to keep track of  individual  conversations.    User  programs
normally  use more or less random port numbers.  However specific port
numbers are assigned to the programs that sit  waiting  for  requests.
For  example,  if  you  want  to send a file, you will start a program
called "ftp".  It will open a connection using some random number, say
1234,  for  the  port number on its end.  However it will specify port
number 21 for the other end.  This is the official port number for the
FTP server.  Note that there are two different programs involved.  You
run ftp on your side.  This is a program designed to  accept  commands
from  your  terminal  and  pass them on to the other end.  The program
that you talk to on the other machine  is  the  FTP  server.    It  is
designed  to  accept commands from the network connection, rather than
an interactive terminal.  There is no need for your program to  use  a
well-known  socket  number  for  itself.  Nobody is trying to find it.
However the servers have to have well-known numbers,  so  that  people
can  open  connections  to  them and start sending them commands.  The
official  port  numbers  for  each  program  are  given  in  "Assigned
Numbers".

Note  that  a  connection is actually described by a set of 4 numbers:
the Internet address at each end, and the TCP port number at each end.
Every  datagram  has  all  four of those numbers in it.  (The Internet
addresses are in the IP header, and the TCP port numbers  are  in  the
TCP header.)  In order to keep things straight, no two connections can
have the same set of numbers.  However it is enough for any one number
to  be  different.    For  example,  it  is perfectly possible for two
different users on a machine to be sending files  to  the  same  other
machine.    This  could  result  in  connections  with  the  following
parameters:

                   Internet addresses         TCP ports
    connection 1  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1234, 21
    connection 2  128.6.4.194, 128.6.4.7      1235, 21

Since the same machines are involved, the Internet addresses  are  the
same.    Since  they  are  both  doing  file transfers, one end of the
connection involves the well-known port number  for  FTP.    The  only
thing  that  differs is the port number for the program that the users
are running.  That's enough of a difference.  Generally, at least  one
end  of  the  connection asks the network software to assign it a port
number that is guaranteed to be unique.   Normally,  it's  the  user's
end, since the server has to use a well-known number.
                                  13
 


Now  that  we  know  how  to  open  connections, let's get back to the
applications programs.  As mentioned earlier, once TCP  has  opened  a
connection,  we  have  something  that might as well be a simple wire.
All the hard parts are handled by TCP and IP.  However we  still  need
some  agreement  as  to  what we send over this connection.  In effect
this is simply an agreement on what set of  commands  the  application
will  understand,  and  the  format  in  which  they  are  to be sent.
Generally, what is sent is a combination of commands and data.    They
use  context  to  differentiate.  For example, the mail protocol works
like this: Your mail program opens a connection to the mail server  at
the  other end.  Your program gives it your machine's name, the sender
of the message, and the recipients you want it sent to.  It then sends
a  command saying that it is starting the message.  At that point, the
other end  stops  treating  what  it  sees  as  commands,  and  starts
accepting  the  message.  Your end then starts sending the text of the
message.  At the end of the message, a special mark is sent (a dot  in
the first column).  After that, both ends understand that your program
is again sending commands.  This is the simplest way to do things, and
the one that most applications use.

File  transfer  is  somewhat more complex.  The file transfer protocol
involves two different connections.  It starts  out  just  like  mail.
The user's program sends commands like "log me in as this user", "here
is my password", "send me the file with this name".  However once  the
command  to  send  data is sent, a second connection is opened for the
data itself.  It would certainly be possible to send the data  on  the
same  connection,  as  mail does.  However file transfers often take a
long time.  The designers of the  file  transfer  protocol  wanted  to
allow  the  user  to  continue  issuing commands while the transfer is
going on.  For example, the user might make an inquiry,  or  he  might
abort  the  transfer.    Thus  the designers felt it was best to use a
separate connection for  the  data  and  leave  the  original  command
connection  for  commands.    (It  is  also  possible  to open command
connections to two different computers, and tell them to send  a  file
from  one  to  the other.  In that case, the data couldn't go over the
command connection.)

Remote terminal connections use another mechanism still.   For  remote
logins,  there  is just one connection.  It normally sends data.  When
it is necessary to send a command (e.g. to set the terminal type or to
change  some  mode),  a special character is used to indicate that the
next character is a command.  If the user happens to type that special
character as data, two of them are sent.

We  are  not  going to describe the application protocols in detail in
this document.  It's better to read the RFC's yourself.  However there
are  a  couple of common conventions used by applications that will be
described here.  First, the common network representation:  TCP/IP  is
intended  to  be  usable  on  any  computer.    Unfortunately, not all
computers agree on how data is represented.  There are differences  in
character  codes  (ASCII  vs.  EBCDIC),  in  end  of  line conventions
(carriage return, line feed, or a representation using counts), and in
whether  terminals expect characters to be sent individually or a line
at a time.   In  order  to  allow  computers  of  different  kinds  to
communicate,   each   applications   protocol   defines   a   standard
                                  14
 


representation.    Note  that  TCP  and  IP  do  not  care  about  the
representation.    TCP  simply  sends octets.  However the programs at
both ends have to agree on how the octets are to be interpreted.   The
RFC  for  each  application  specifies the standard representation for
that application.  Normally it  is  "net  ASCII".    This  uses  ASCII
characters,  with end of line denoted by a carriage return followed by
a line feed.  For remote login,  there  is  also  a  definition  of  a
"standard terminal", which turns out to be a half-duplex terminal with
echoing happening on the local machine.  Most applications  also  make
provisions  for  the  two  computers to agree on other representations
that they may find more convenient.  For example, PDP-10's have 36-bit
words.    There  is a way that two PDP-10's can agree to send a 36-bit
binary file.  Similarly, two systems that prefer full-duplex  terminal
conversations  can  agree  on  that.    However each application has a
standard representation, which every machine must support.



3.1 An example application: SMTP


In order to give a bit better idea what is involved in the application
protocols,  I'm  going  to  show an example of SMTP, which is the mail
protocol.  (SMTP is "simple mail transfer protocol.)  We assume that a
computer called TOPAZ.RUTGERS.EDU wants to send the following message.

  Date: Sat, 27 Jun 87 13:26:31 EDT
  From: hedrick@topaz.rutgers.edu
  To: levy@red.rutgers.edu
  Subject: meeting

  Let's get together Monday at 1pm.

First,  note  that the format of the message itself is described by an
Internet standard (RFC 822).  The standard specifies the fact that the
message  must be transmitted as net ASCII (i.e. it must be ASCII, with
carriage return/linefeed to delimit lines).   It  also  describes  the
general  structure, as a group of header lines, then a blank line, and
then the body of the message.  Finally, it describes the syntax of the
header  lines in detail.  Generally they consist of a keyword and then
a value.

Note  that  the  addressee  is  indicated   as   LEVY@RED.RUTGERS.EDU.
Initially,  addresses were simply "person at machine".  However recent
standards have made things more flexible.  There  are  now  provisions
for  systems  to handle other systems' mail.  This can allow automatic
forwarding on behalf of computers not connected to the Internet.    It
can be used to direct mail for a number of systems to one central mail
server.  Indeed there is no requirement that an actual computer by the
name  of RED.RUTGERS.EDU even exist.  The name servers could be set up
so that you mail to department names, and each  department's  mail  is
routed  automatically to an appropriate computer.  It is also possible
that the part before the @ is something other than a user name.  It is
possible  for  programs  to be set up to process mail.  There are also
provisions  to  handle  mailing  lists,  and  generic  names  such  as
                                  15
 


"postmaster" or "operator".

The  way  the  message is to be sent to another system is described by
RFC's 821 and 974.  The program that is going to be doing the  sending
asks  the  name server several queries to determine where to route the
message.  The first query is to find out which  machines  handle  mail
for  the  name RED.RUTGERS.EDU.  In this case, the server replies that
RED.RUTGERS.EDU handles its own mail.  The program then asks  for  the
address of RED.RUTGERS.EDU, which is 128.6.4.2.  Then the mail program
opens a TCP connection to port 25  on  128.6.4.2.    Port  25  is  the
well-known  socket  used  for receiving mail.  Once this connection is
established, the mail program starts sending  commands.    Here  is  a
typical  conversation.  Each line is labelled as to whether it is from
TOPAZ or RED.  Note that TOPAZ initiated the connection:

    RED    220 RED.RUTGERS.EDU SMTP Service at 29 Jun 87 05:17:18 EDT

First, note that commands all use normal text.  This is typical of the
Internet  standards.    Many  of  the  protocols  use  standard  ASCII
commands.  This makes it easy  to  watch  what  is  going  on  and  to
diagnose  problems.  For example, the mail program keeps a log of each
conversation.  If something goes wrong, the log  file  can  simply  be
mailed  to  the  postmaster.  Since it is normal text, he can see what
was going on.  It also allows a human to interact  directly  with  the
mail  server,  for  testing.  (Some newer protocols are complex enough
that this is not practical.  The commands would have to have a  syntax
that would require a significant parser.  Thus there is a tendency for
newer protocols to use binary formats.  Generally they are  structured
like  C or Pascal record structures.)  Second, note that the responses
all begin with numbers.  This is also typical of  Internet  protocols.
The  allowable  responses  are  defined  in the protocol.  The numbers
allow the user program to respond unambiguously.    The  rest  of  the
response  is  text,  which is normally for use by any human who may be
watching or looking at a log.  It has no effect on  the  operation  of
the  programs.  (However there is one point at which the protocol uses
part of the text of the response.)   The  commands  themselves  simply
allow  the  mail  program  on  one  end  to  tell  the mail server the
                                  16
 


information it needs to know in order to deliver the message.  In this
case,  the  mail  server  could  get the information by looking at the
message itself.  But for more complex cases, that would not  be  safe.
Every  session  must  begin  with  a HELO, which gives the name of the
system that initiated the connection.  Then the sender and  recipients
are specified.  (There can be more than one RCPT command, if there are
several recipients.)  Finally the data itself is sent.  Note that  the
text  of the message is terminated by a line containing just a period.
(If such a line appears in the message, the period is doubled.)  After
the  message  is  accepted,  the  sender  can send another message, or
terminate the session as in the example above.

Generally, there is a pattern to the response numbers.   The  protocol
defines  the  specific set of responses that can be sent as answers to
any given command.  However programs that don't want to  analyze  them
in  detail  can  just  look at the first digit.  In general, responses
that begin with a 2  indicate  success.    Those  that  begin  with  3
indicate  that some further action is needed, as shown above.  4 and 5
indicate errors.  4 is a "temporary" error, such as  a  disk  filling.
The  message should be saved, and tried again later.  5 is a permanent
error, such as a  non-existent  recipient.    The  message  should  be
returned to the sender with an error message.

(For  more  details about the protocols mentioned in this section, see
RFC's 821/822 for mail, RFC 959 for file transfer, and  RFC's  854/855
for  remote  logins.  For the well-known port numbers, see the current
edition of Assigned Numbers, and possibly RFC 814.)



4. Protocols other than TCP: UDP and ICMP


So far, we have described only connections that use TCP.  Recall  that
TCP  is  responsible  for  breaking  up  messages  into datagrams, and
reassembling them properly.  However in  many  applications,  we  have
messages  that  will  always  fit in a single datagram.  An example is
name lookup.  When a user attempts to make  a  connection  to  another
system,  he  will  generally  specify  the system by name, rather than
Internet address.  His system has to translate that name to an address
before  it  can  do  anything.  Generally, only a few systems have the
database used to translate names to addresses.  So the  user's  system
will want to send a query to one of the systems that has the database.
This query is going to be very short.  It will certainly  fit  in  one
datagram.    So  will the answer.  Thus it seems silly to use TCP.  Of
course TCP does more than just break things up  into  datagrams.    It
also  makes  sure  that  the  data  arrives, resending datagrams where
necessary.  But for a question that fits  in  a  single  datagram,  we
don't  need  all the complexity of TCP to do this.  If we don't get an
answer after a few seconds, we can just ask again.   For  applications
like this, there are alternatives to TCP.

The most common alternative is UDP ("user datagram protocol").  UDP is
designed for applications where you don't need  to  put  sequences  of
datagrams  together.  It fits into the system much like TCP.  There is
                                  17
 


a UDP header.  The network software puts the UDP header on  the  front
of  your  data, just as it would put a TCP header on the front of your
data.  Then UDP sends the data  to  IP,  which  adds  the  IP  header,
putting  UDP's  protocol number in the protocol field instead of TCP's
protocol number.  However UDP doesn't do as much  as  TCP  does.    It
doesn't  split data into multiple datagrams.  It doesn't keep track of
what it has sent so it can resend if necessary.  About  all  that  UDP
provides  is  port  numbers,  so  that several programs can use UDP at
once.  UDP port numbers are used just like TCP port  numbers.    There
are  well-known  port numbers for servers that use UDP.  Note that the
UDP header is shorter than a TCP header.   It  still  has  source  and
destination  port  numbers,  and  a checksum, but that's about it.  No
sequence number, since it is not needed.  UDP is used by the protocols
that  handle  name  lookups (see IEN 116, RFC 882, and RFC 883), and a
number of similar protocols.

Another  alternative  protocol  is  ICMP  ("Internet  control  message
protocol").    ICMP  is  used  for  error messages, and other messages
intended for the TCP/IP software itself, rather  than  any  particular
user  program.  For example, if you attempt to connect to a host, your
system may get back an ICMP message saying "host unreachable".    ICMP
can  also be used to find out some information about the network.  See
RFC 792 for details of ICMP.  ICMP is  similar  to  UDP,  in  that  it
handles messages that fit in one datagram.  However it is even simpler
than UDP.  It doesn't even have port numbers in its header.  Since all
ICMP  messages are interpreted by the network software itself, no port
numbers are needed to say where a ICMP message is supposed to go.



5. Keeping track of names and information: the domain system


As we indicated earlier, the network software generally needs a 32-bit
Internet  address  in  order  to open a connection or send a datagram.
However users prefer to deal with computer names rather than  numbers.
Thus  there  is  a database that allows the software to look up a name
and find the corresponding number.  When the Internet was small,  this
was  easy.  Each system would have a file that listed all of the other
systems, giving both their name and number.  There are  now  too  many
computers  for  this  approach to be practical.  Thus these files have
been replaced by a set of name servers that keep track of  host  names
and  the corresponding Internet addresses.  (In fact these servers are
somewhat more general than that.  This is just one kind of information
stored in the domain system.)  Note that a set of interlocking servers
are used, rather than a single central one.  There  are  now  so  many
different  institutions  connected  to  the  Internet that it would be
impractical for them to  notify  a  central  authority  whenever  they
installed  or moved a computer.  Thus naming authority is delegated to
individual institutions.  The name servers form a tree,  corresponding
to  institutional  structure.    The names themselves follow a similar
structure.  A typical example is the name BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  This  is
a  computer  at  the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) at MIT.  In
order to find its Internet address,  you  might  potentially  have  to
consult  4  different  servers.  First, you would ask a central server
                                  18
 


(called the root) where the EDU server is.  EDU is a server that keeps
track of educational institutions.  The root server would give you the
names and Internet addresses of several servers for EDU.   (There  are
several  servers  at  each  level,  to allow for the possibly that one
might be down.)  You would then ask EDU where the server for  MIT  is.
Again,  it  would  give  you  names  and Internet addresses of several
servers for MIT.  Generally, not all of those servers would be at MIT,
to  allow for the possibility of a general power failure at MIT.  Then
you would ask MIT where the server for LCS is, and finally  you  would
ask one of the LCS servers about BORAX.  The final result would be the
Internet address for BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.    Each  of  these  levels  is
referred  to  as  a  "domain".  The entire name, BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU, is
called a "domain name".    (So  are  the  names  of  the  higher-level
domains, such as LCS.MIT.EDU, MIT.EDU, and EDU.)

Fortunately,  you  don't really have to go through all of this most of
the time.  First of all, the root name servers also happen to  be  the
name  servers  for  the  top-level domains such as EDU.  Thus a single
query to a root  server  will  get  you  to  MIT.    Second,  software
generally  remembers answers that it got before.  So once we look up a
name at LCS.MIT.EDU, our software remembers where to find servers  for
LCS.MIT.EDU,  MIT.EDU,  and EDU.  It also remembers the translation of
BORAX.LCS.MIT.EDU.  Each of these pieces of information has a "time to
live"  associated with it.  Typically this is a few days.  After that,
the information expires and has to be looked up again.    This  allows
institutions to change things.

The  domain  system  is not limited to finding out Internet addresses.
Each domain name is a node in a database.  The node can  have  records
that  define  a number of different properties.  Examples are Internet
address, computer type, and a list of services provided by a computer.
A  program  can  ask  for  a  specific  piece  of  information, or all
information about a given name.  It is possible  for  a  node  in  the
database  to  be  marked as an "alias" (or nickname) for another node.
It is also possible to use the  domain  system  to  store  information
about users, mailing lists, or other objects.

There  is  an  Internet  standard  defining  the  operation  of  these
databases, as well as the protocols used  to  make  queries  of  them.
Every  network utility has to be able to make such queries, since this
is now the official way to evaluate host names.   Generally  utilities
will talk to a server on their own system.  This server will take care
of contacting the other servers for them.  This keeps down the  amount
of code that has to be in each application program.

The  domain  system  is  particularly  important for handling computer
mail.  There are entry types to define what computer handles mail  for
a  given  name, to specify where an individual is to receive mail, and
to define mailing lists.

(See RFC's 882, 883, and 973 for specifications of the domain  system.
RFC 974 defines the use of the domain system in sending mail.)

6. Routing


The   description  above  indicated  that  the  IP  implementation  is
responsible for getting datagrams to the destination indicated by  the
destination address, but little was said about how this would be done.
The task of finding how to  get  a  datagram  to  its  destination  is
referred to as "routing".  In fact many of the details depend upon the
particular implementation.  However some general things can be said.

First, it is necessary to understand the model on which IP  is  based.
IP assumes that a system is attached to some local network.  We assume
that the system can send datagrams to any  other  system  on  its  own
network.    (In  the  case  of  Ethernet, it simply finds the Ethernet
address of the destination system, and puts the datagram  out  on  the
Ethernet.)    The  problem  comes  when  a  system  is asked to send a
datagram to a system on a different network.  This problem is  handled
by  gateways.   A gateway is a system that connects a network with one
or more other networks.  Gateways  are  often  normal  computers  that
happen  to have more than one network interface.  For example, we have
a Unix machine that has two different Ethernet interfaces.  Thus it is
connected  to networks 128.6.4 and 128.6.3.  This machine can act as a
gateway between those two networks.  The software on that machine must
be  set  up  so that it will forward datagrams from one network to the
other.  That is, if a machine on network 128.6.4 sends a  datagram  to
the  gateway,  and  the  datagram is addressed to a machine on network
128.6.3, the gateway will forward the  datagram  to  the  destination.
Major communications centers often have gateways that connect a number
of different  networks.    (In  many  cases,  special-purpose  gateway
systems provide better performance or reliability than general-purpose
systems acting as gateways.  A number of vendors sell such systems.)

Routing in IP is  based  entirely  upon  the  network  number  of  the
destination  address.    Each computer has a table of network numbers.
For each network number, a gateway is listed.  This is the gateway  to
be used to get to that network.  Note that the gateway doesn't have to
connect directly to the network.  It just has to be the best place  to
go  to  get there.  For example at Rutgers, our interface to NSFnet is
at the John von Neuman Supercomputer Center (JvNC). Our connection  to
JvNC  is  via  a  high-speed  serial line connected to a gateway whose
address is 128.6.3.12.  Systems on net 128.6.3 will list 128.6.3.12 as
the  gateway  for  many  off-campus  networks.  However systems on net
128.6.4 will list 128.6.4.1 as the gateway to  those  same  off-campus
networks.    128.6.4.1  is  the  gateway  between networks 128.6.4 and
128.6.3, so it is the first step in getting to JvNC.

When a computer wants to send a datagram, it first checks  to  see  if
the  destination address is on the system's own local network.  If so,
the datagram can be sent directly.  Otherwise, the system  expects  to
find an entry for the network that the destination address is on.  The
datagram is sent to the gateway listed in that entry.  This table  can
get quite big.  For example, the Internet now includes several hundred
individual networks.  Thus various strategies have been  developed  to
reduce  the size of the routing table.  One strategy is to depend upon
"default routes".  Often, there is only one gateway out of a  network.
                                  20
 


This  gateway might connect a local Ethernet to a campus-wide backbone
network.  In that case, we don't need to have  a  separate  entry  for
every  network  in  the  world.    We  simply define that gateway as a
"default".  When no specific  route  is  found  for  a  datagram,  the
datagram  is  sent to the default gateway.  A default gateway can even
be used when there are several gateways  on  a  network.    There  are
provisions  for  gateways  to  send a message saying "I'm not the best
gateway -- use this one instead."  (The message is sent via ICMP.  See
RFC  792.)  Most network software is designed to use these messages to
add entries to their routing tables.  Suppose network 128.6.4 has  two
gateways, 128.6.4.59 and 128.6.4.1.  128.6.4.59 leads to several other
internal Rutgers networks.  128.6.4.1 leads indirectly to the  NSFnet.
Suppose  we  set  128.6.4.59  as  a default gateway, and have no other
routing table entries.  Now what  happens  when  we  need  to  send  a
datagram  to  MIT?    MIT  is  network 18.  Since we have no entry for
network 18, the datagram will be sent to the default, 128.6.4.59.   As
it  happens,  this  gateway  is the wrong one.  So it will forward the
datagram to 128.6.4.1.  But it will also send back an error saying  in
effect: "to get to network 18, use 128.6.4.1".  Our software will then
add an entry to the routing table.  Any future datagrams to  MIT  will
then  go  directly to 128.6.4.1.  (The error message is sent using the
ICMP protocol.  The message type is called "ICMP redirect.")

Most IP experts recommend that individual computers should not try  to
keep  track  of  the  entire network.  Instead, they should start with
default gateways, and let the gateways tell them the routes,  as  just
described.   However this doesn't say how the gateways should find out
about the routes.  The gateways can't depend upon this strategy.  They
have  to  have fairly complete routing tables.  For this, some sort of
routing protocol is needed.  A routing protocol is simply a  technique
for  the  gateways  to  find each other, and keep up to date about the
best way to get to every network.   RFC  1009  contains  a  review  of
gateway  design  and  routing.    However rip.doc is probably a better
introduction to the subject.  It contains some tutorial material,  and
a detailed description of the most commonly-used routing protocol.



7. Details about Internet addresses: subnets and broadcasting


As  indicated earlier, Internet addresses are 32-bit numbers, normally
written as 4 octets (in decimal), e.g. 128.6.4.7.  There are  actually
3  different types of address.  The problem is that the address has to
indicate both the network and the host within the  network.    It  was
felt  that  eventually  there would be lots of networks.  Many of them
would be small, but probably 24 bits would be needed to represent  all
the  IP  networks.  It was also felt that some very big networks might
need 24 bits to represent all of their hosts.  This would seem to lead
to  48  bit  addresses.  But the designers really wanted to use 32 bit
addresses.  So they adopted a kludge.  The assumption is that most  of
the  networks will be small.  So they set up three different ranges of
address.  Addresses beginning with 1 to 126 use only the  first  octet
for  the network number.  The other three octets are available for the
host number.  Thus 24 bits are available for hosts.  These numbers are
                                  21
 


used  for large networks.  But there can only be 126 of these very big
networks.  The Arpanet is one, and there are a  few  large  commercial
networks.    But  few  normal organizations get one of these "class A"
addresses.  For normal large organizations, "class  B"  addresses  are
used.    Class  B  addresses  use the first two octets for the network
number.  Thus network numbers are 128.1 through 191.254.  (We avoid  0
and  255,  for  reasons  that  we  see below.  We also avoid addresses
beginning with 127, because that is used by some systems  for  special
purposes.)    The  last  two  octets  are available for host addesses,
giving 16 bits of host address.   This  allows  for  64516  computers,
which should be enough for most organizations.  (It is possible to get
more than one class B address, if you run  out.)    Finally,  class  C
addresses  use  three  octets,  in  the  range 192.1.1 to 223.254.254.
These allow only 254 hosts on each network, but there can be  lots  of
these  networks.   Addresses above 223 are reserved for future use, as
class D and E (which are currently not defined).

Many large organizations find it convenient to  divide  their  network
number into "subnets".  For example, Rutgers has been assigned a class
B address, 128.6.  We find it convenient to use the third octet of the
address to indicate which Ethernet a host is on.  This division has no
significance outside of Rutgers.  A computer  at  another  institution
would treat all datagrams addressed to 128.6 the same way.  They would
not look at the third octet of the address.   Thus  computers  outside
Rutgers  would  not have different routes for 128.6.4 or 128.6.5.  But
inside Rutgers, we treat 128.6.4 and 128.6.5 as separate networks.  In
effect, gateways inside Rutgers have separate entries for each Rutgers
subnet, whereas gateways outside  Rutgers  just  have  one  entry  for
128.6.  Note  that  we  could  do  exactly  the  same thing by using a
separate class C address for each Ethernet.   As  far  as  Rutgers  is
concerned,  it  would be just as convenient for us to have a number of
class C addresses.  However using class C addresses would make  things
inconvenient for the rest of the world.  Every institution that wanted
to talk to us would have to have a separate entry for each one of  our
networks.   If every institution did this, there would be far too many
networks for any reasonable gateway to keep track of.  By  subdividing
a  class B network, we hide our internal structure from everyone else,
and  save  them  trouble.    This  subnet  strategy  requires  special
provisions in the network software.  It is described in RFC 950.

0  and  255  have  special  meanings.  0 is reserved for machines that
don't know their address.  In certain circumstances it is possible for
a  machine not to know the number of the network it is on, or even its
own host address.  For example, 0.0.0.23 would be a machine that  knew
it was host number 23, but didn't know on what network.

255  is  used for "broadcast".  A broadcast is a message that you want
every system on the network to see.    Broadcasts  are  used  in  some
situations  where you don't know who to talk to.  For example, suppose
you need to look  up  a  host  name  and  get  its  Internet  address.
Sometimes  you  don't know the address of the nearest name server.  In
that case, you might send the request as a broadcast.  There are  also
cases  where a number of systems are interested in information.  It is
then less expensive to send a single broadcast than to send  datagrams
individually  to  each host that is interested in the information.  In
                                  22
 


order to send a broadcast, you use an address that is  made  by  using
your  network  address, with all ones in the part of the address where
the host number goes.  For example, if you are on network 128.6.4, you
would   use   128.6.4.255  for  broadcasts.    How  this  is  actually
implemented depends upon the medium.   It  is  not  possible  to  send
broadcasts  on the Arpanet, or on point to point lines.  However it is
possible on an Ethernet.  If you use an Ethernet address with all  its
bits  on (all ones), every machine on the Ethernet is supposed to look
at that datagram.

Although the official broadcast address for  network  128.6.4  is  now
128.6.4.255,  there  are  some  other addresses that may be treated as
broadcasts by certain implementations.  For convenience, the  standard
also  allows  255.255.255.255 to be used.  This refers to all hosts on
the local network.  It is often simpler to use 255.255.255.255 instead
of  finding out the network number for the local network and forming a
broadcast address such as 128.6.4.255.   In  addition,  certain  older
implementations  may  use  0  instead  of  255  to  form the broadcast
address.    Such  implementations  would  use  128.6.4.0  instead   of
128.6.4.255  as  the  broadcast  address on network 128.6.4.  Finally,
certain older implementations may not understand about subnets.   Thus
they consider the network number to be 128.6.  In that case, they will
assume a broadcast address  of  128.6.255.255  or  128.6.0.0.    Until
support  for  broadcasts is implemented properly, it can be a somewhat
dangerous feature to use.

Because 0 and 255 are used for unknown and broadcast addresses, normal
hosts  should never be given addresses containing 0 or 255.  Addresses
should never begin with 0, 127, or any number above  223.    Addresses
violating these rules are sometimes referred to as "Martians", because
of rumors that the Central University of Mars is using network 225.



8. Datagram fragmentation and reassembly


TCP/IP is designed for use  with  many  different  kinds  of  network.
Unfortunately,  network  designers  do not agree about how big packets
can be.  Ethernet packets can be 1500 octets long.    Arpanet  packets
have  a  maximum  of around 1000 octets.  Some very fast networks have
much larger packet sizes.  At first, you might think  that  IP  should
simply  settle  on  the  smallest  possible size.  Unfortunately, this
would cause serious performance problems.    When  transferring  large
files, big packets are far more efficient than small ones.  So we want
to be able to use the largest packet size possible.  But we also  want
to  be  able  to  handle  networks  with  small limits.  There are two
provisions for this.  First, TCP has the ability to "negotiate"  about
datagram  size.  When a TCP connection first opens, both ends can send
the maximum datagram size they can  handle.    The  smaller  of  these
numbers  is  used  for  the  rest  of the connection.  This allows two
implementations that can handle big datagrams to use  them,  but  also
lets  them  talk  to  implementations that can't handle them.  However
this doesn't completely solve the problem.  The most  serious  problem
is  that the two ends don't necessarily know about all of the steps in
                                  23
 


between.  For example, when sending data between Rutgers and Berkeley,
it is likely that both computers will be on Ethernets.  Thus they will
both  be  prepared  to  handle  1500-octet  datagrams.    However  the
connection will at some point end up going over the Arpanet.  It can't
handle packets of that size.  For this reason, there are provisions to
split   datagrams   up   into   pieces.    (This  is  referred  to  as
"fragmentation".)  The IP header  contains  fields  indicating  the  a
datagram  has  been split, and enough information to let the pieces be
put back together.  If a gateway connects an Ethernet to the  Arpanet,
it must be prepared to take 1500-octet Ethernet packets and split them
into pieces that will fit on the Arpanet.    Furthermore,  every  host
implementation  of  TCP/IP  must  be prepared to accept pieces and put
them back together.  This is referred to as "reassembly".

TCP/IP implementations differ in the approach they take to deciding on
datagram  size.    It  is  fairly  common  for  implementations to use
576-byte datagrams whenever they can't verify that the entire path  is
able  to  handle larger packets.  This rather conservative strategy is
used because of the number of implementations with bugs in the code to
reassemble  fragments.    Implementors  often try to avoid ever having
fragmentation occur.  Different implementors take different approaches
to  deciding  when  it  is safe to use large datagrams.  Some use them
only for the local network.  Others will use them for any  network  on
the   same   campus.    576  bytes  is  a  "safe"  size,  which  every
implementation must support.



9. Ethernet encapsulation: ARP


There was a brief discussion earlier about what IP datagrams look like
on  an  Ethernet.    The  discussion  showed  the  Ethernet header and
checksum.  However it left one hole: It didn't say how to  figure  out
what Ethernet address to use when you want to talk to a given Internet
address.  In fact, there is a separate protocol for this,  called  ARP
("address  resolution protocol").  (Note by the way that ARP is not an
IP protocol.  That is, the ARP datagrams  do  not  have  IP  headers.)
Suppose  you  are  on  system  128.6.4.194  and you want to connect to
system 128.6.4.7.  Your system will first verify that 128.6.4.7 is  on
the  same network, so it can talk directly via Ethernet.  Then it will
look up 128.6.4.7 in its ARP table, to see if  it  already  knows  the
Ethernet  address.    If  so, it will stick on an Ethernet header, and
send the packet.  But suppose this system is not  in  the  ARP  table.
There  is  no  way  to  send the packet, because you need the Ethernet
address.  So it  uses  the  ARP  protocol  to  send  an  ARP  request.
Essentially  an  ARP  request  says  "I  need the Ethernet address for
128.6.4.7".  Every system listens to ARP requests.  When a system sees
an  ARP  request  for itself, it is required to respond.  So 128.6.4.7
will see the request, and will respond with an  ARP  reply  saying  in
effect "128.6.4.7 is 8:0:20:1:56:34".  (Recall that Ethernet addresses
are 48 bits.  This is 6 octets.  Ethernet addresses are conventionally
shown  in  hex,  using  the punctuation shown.)  Your system will save
this information in its ARP table, so future packets will go directly.
Most  systems  treat the ARP table as a cache, and clear entries in it
                                  24
 


if they have not been used in a certain period of time.

Note by the way that ARP requests must be sent as "broadcasts".  There
is  no  way  that  an  ARP  request  can be sent directly to the right
system.  After all, the whole reason for sending  an  ARP  request  is
that  you  don't know the Ethernet address.  So an Ethernet address of
all ones is  used,  i.e.  ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.    By  convention,  every
machine  on  the Ethernet is required to pay attention to packets with
this as an address.  So every system sees every ARP  requests.    They
all  look to see whether the request is for their own address.  If so,
they respond.  If not, they could just ignore it.   (Some  hosts  will
use  ARP  requests  to update their knowledge about other hosts on the
network, even if the request isn't for them.)  Note that packets whose
IP  address  indicates broadcast (e.g. 255.255.255.255 or 128.6.4.255)
are also sent with an Ethernet address that is all ones.



10. Getting more information


This directory contains  documents  describing  the  major  protocols.
There  are literally hundreds of documents, so we have chosen the ones
that seem most important.  Internet standards are called RFC's.    RFC
stands  for  Request  for  Comment.   A proposed standard is initially
issued as a proposal, and given an RFC number.   When  it  is  finally
accepted,  it is added to Official Internet Protocols, but it is still
referred to by the RFC number.   We  have  also  included  two  IEN's.
(IEN's  used  to  be  a  separate  classification  for  more  informal
documents.  This classification no longer exists -- RFC's are now used
for  all  official  Internet documents, and a mailing list is used for
more informal reports.)  The convention is that  whenever  an  RFC  is
revised, the revised version gets a new number.  This is fine for most
purposes, but it causes problems with two documents: Assigned  Numbers
and  Official  Internet  Protocols.  These documents are being revised
all the time, so the RFC number keeps changing.  You will have to look
in rfc-index.txt to find the number of the latest edition.  Anyone who
is seriously interested in TCP/IP should read the  RFC  describing  IP
(791).    RFC 1009 is also useful.  It is a specification for gateways
to be used by NSFnet.  As such, it contains an overview of  a  lot  of
the  TCP/IP technology.  You should probably also read the description
of at least one of the application protocols, just to get a  feel  for
the  way  things  work.    Mail is probably a good one (821/822).  TCP
(793) is of course a very basic specification.  However  the  spec  is
fairly  complex,  so  you should only read this when you have the time
and patience to think about it carefully.  Fortunately, the author  of
the  major  RFC's  (Jon Postel) is a very good writer.  The TCP RFC is
far easier to read than you would expect, given the complexity of what
it  is  describing.    You  can  look at the other RFC's as you become
curious about their subject matter.

Here is a list of the documents you are more likely to want:

     rfc-index list of all RFC's

                                  25
 


     rfc1065/6/7
               Simple  Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  A protocol
               to get information from gateways and hosts, to  monitor
               failures,   and   to  reconfigure  gateways  and  hosts
               remotely.  This protocol will  be  the  foundation  for
               network  management  activities  involving TCP/IP.  RFC
               1028 documents the Simple Gateway  Monitoring  Protocol
               (SGMP),  which  is an interim protocol on which SNMP is
               based.  SGMP will be replaced by SNMP during 1988/89.

     rfc1064,1056,937
               protocols for reading mail on PC's

     rfc1062   Assigned  Numbers.  If you are working with TCP/IP, you
               will probably want a hardcopy of this as  a  reference.
               It's  not  very exciting to read, but is essential.  It
               lists all the offically defined  well-known  ports  and
               lots of other things.

     rfc1059   Network  Time  Protocol.   A protocol for synchronizing
               the time on all your machines.  Also allows you to  get
               time from one of the national time standards.

     rfc1058   Routing  Information  Protocol.    Details  of the most
               commonly-used routing protocol.

     rfc1057   RPC.  A protocol for remote  procedure  calls.    Sun's
               Network  File  System is based on this.  The actual NFS
               protocol specification is currently available only from
               Sun.    Sun  supplies a public domain implementation of
               RPC.  Aside from its use by NFS  (whose  implementation
               is not public domain), RPC has been used by a number of
               groups  for  building  server/client  systems  such  as
               remote database servers.  See also RFC 1014.

     rfc1042   IP  encapsulation  for IEEE 802 networks.  This will be
               used for the IEEE  token  ring,  broadband,  etc.    In
               principle  it  seems  that  this  would cover Ethernet,
               since  Ethernet  is  IEEE  802.3.  However  the  normal
               encapsulation used on Ethernet is defined by RFC 894.

     rfc1032/3/4/5
               domains (the database used to go  from  host  names  to
               Internet  address  and back -- also used to handle UUCP
               these days).  This includes protocol standards, as well
               as information directed at people who are going to have
               to set up a domain name server.  Every site should have
               a copy of these documents.

     rfc1014   XDR:  External  Data  Representation Standard.  This is
               part of the specifications for Sun's RPC protocol  (RFC
               1057),  which  is the protocol underlying Sun's Network
               File System.

     rfc1013   X Window System Protocol, Version 11.    Documents  the
                                  26
 


               most commonly used remote window system.

     rfc1012   list  of  all  RFC's  below  1000,  with  somewhat more
               information than rfc-index.

     rfc1011   Official Protocols.  It's useful to scan  this  to  see
               what tasks protocols have been built for.  This defines
               which  RFC's  are  actual  standards,  as  opposed   to
               requests for comments.

     rfc1009   NSFnet  gateway  specifications.  A good overview of IP
               routing and gateway technology.

     rfc1001/2 netBIOS: networking for PC's

     rfc959    FTP (file transfer)

     rfc950    subnets

     rfc894    how IP is to be put on Ethernet, see also rfc825

     rfc854/5  telnet - protocol for remote logins

     rfc826    ARP - protocol for finding out Ethernet addresses

     rfc821/2  mail

     rfc814    names and ports - general  concepts  behind  well-known
               ports

     rfc793    TCP

     rfc792    ICMP

     rfc791    IP

     rfc768    UDP

     ien-116   old  name  server  (still  needed  by  several kinds of
               system)

     ien-48    the  Catenet  model,   general   description   of   the
               philosophy behind TCP/IP

The following documents are somewhat more specialized.

     rfc1055   SLIP (IP for dialup lines)

     rfc1054   IP multicasting

     rfc1048   Bootp,  a protocol often used to allow diskless systems
               to find their IP address.

     rfc813    window and acknowledgement strategies in TCP

                                  27
 


     rfc815    datagram reassembly techniques

     rfc816    fault isolation and resolution techniques

     rfc817    modularity and efficiency in implementation

     rfc879    the maximum segment size option in TCP

     rfc896    congestion control

     rfc827,888,904,975,985
               EGP and related issues

To  those  of you who may be reading this document remotely instead of
at Rutgers: The most  important  RFC's  have  been  collected  into  a
three-volume set, the DDN Protocol Handbook.  It is available from the
DDN Network Information  Center,  SRI  International,  333  Ravenswood
Avenue,  Menlo  Park, California 94025 (telephone: 800-235-3155).  You
should be able to get them via anonymous FTP from sri-nic.arpa.   File
names are:

  RFC's:
    rfc:rfc-index.txt
    rfc:rfcxxx.txt
  IEN's:
    ien:ien-index.txt
    ien:ien-xxx.txt

Sites with access to UUCP but not FTP may be able to retreive them via
UUCP from UUCP host rutgers.  The file names would be

  RFC's:
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/rfc-index.txt
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/rfcxxx.txt
  IEN's:
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/ien-index.txt
    /topaz/pub/pub/tcp-ip-docs/ien-xxx.txt

Note that SRI-NIC has the entire set of RFC's and IEN's,  but  rutgers
and topaz have only those specifically mentioned above.

** LETTER D70 ***

Hello again fellow GMJ readers.  Lots going on right now here at GMJ.
The first Electronic Print issue is finally out and we have been
overwhelmed by the response.  For those of you who just can't afford
the lengthy download, we have an extremely low price for a
subscription offer.  Check out an ad this issue for all of the
details.

The main theme the last few weeks has to be the 3DO.  Panasonic
released the $700 monster early November and it is taking off pretty
well.  We had a chance to test this money vacuum out recently and we
were pretty impressed.  Check out the Power Switch section this issue
to get all of the hands on test details for the 3DO from the Game
Masters.

You Genesis players will be happy to hear that Mortal Kombat is the
number one selling 16 bit title right now even topping the SNES
version in sales for last month.  Why? I really don't know.  The SNES
version is a much better translation.  I guess this just proves that
MK's blood and gore is what makes it.

You are really going to start to see expanded coverage starting this
issue.  We are still playing around with the formats both Ansi and
Electronic Print.  You probably noticed fact windows in our review
section in issue #32 with a few new pieces of information like megs,
who reviewed the game and average of reviews.  Adding to that, is our
hyper text capsules which will be featured next to random reviews.
These capsules will have game PREviews and tidbits of info.

Don't expect to see GMJ every week anymore, we are changing to
bi-weekly.  The reason is that we can put out a much higher quality
issue in 2 weeks and we have reached a point where it is no longer
necessary to come out weekly.  The Elec- tronic print version will
stay monthly and will come out 12+ times per year.

Those of you reading the Electronic Print version enjoyed some Super
SFII art on our cover done by my sister...I'm sorry.  I really am.  I
didn't want to do it, but Street Fighter is Street Fighter and I had
to do it.  I promise there won't be eight SFII covers with in the next
12 issues! While we are on the subject however, check out some
exclusive Super Street Fighter coverage this issue: All the moves for
every character! (and we even avoided listing those phunky character
profiles.  You know, the ones that tell you how many hours of sleep
Ryu gets before his hard training at the Dojo.)

Hey everybody, before I let you read on, let me remind you to not buy
any new systems until sometime in '95 when Nintendo will release their
recently announced 64 Bit system (which by the way GMJ reported before
ANYONE else) for under $250.....yeah right! Ok, so even if it is so
great, and it is that inexpensive, why am I going to wait until 1995?
Listen, if you are always waiting for the next best thing, you will
never own anything.  I like Sega's approach.  Give us a system when
it's ready, let us enjoy it, and release a new system when it's time.
If I had listened to Nintendo last year trying to convince me not to
buy a Sega CD because their more advanced CD would be here in early
'93 and for less, I would be pretty pissed off right now.

Well, that is it for now.  Enjoy our expanded coverage and additional
sections.

      -  Reny Falzarano  [Da Phunky Pheel One]

Just like Mortal Kombat (but with less hype), Konami's Zombies Ate My
Neighbors was released for the S-NES and Genesis on the same day, so
we here at GMJ decided to run a comparison explaining the differences
in each of the versions.  So sit back and relax, 'cause this is one
wild ride.

Both the S-Nes and Genesis versions share the same story-line; to stop
the hordes of evil from capturing your local towns occupants.  You can
choose to rush into action as either a guy that looks like a follower
of Beavis and Butthead, or a pony tail wielding woman that might be
the twin of Mindy from the tv show "Mork and Mindy".  A two player
cooperative option is available so that you're not alone in this never
ending fight to save your town.

Zombies uses a "tongue in cheek" approach to killing the baddies,
because the weapons you use include a water gun, weed whacker, fire
extinguisher, apples, and other household goodies.  You fight in over
forty levels of never ending mayhem, with some levels including a
local mall, a school, and a maze of hedges.  The enemies in this game
are too numerous to count because they all change according to the
level your playing on.  This unique approach makes the game original,
but there is no attention given to the progress of any story.  The
only real goal is to "tag" the residents of the level before a bad guy
kills them.  The residents are spread out all around the levels, and
each level ends when all the people have either been saved or killed.


S-NES version - 83

The S-NES version and Genesis versions of Zombie both sport the same
levels and the same graphics, but the S-NES uses music and sound a
whole lot more effectively, and the control is be better on this one
as well because of the more buttons used.  The title screen is the
first sign that really shows the differences; the S-Nes version has
the Zombies logo gradually morph into view, where the Genesis version
has very little morphing.  The opening music and voices are also done
better on the S-NES version.

The play mechanics and control are a lot better on the S-NES version
because it's full screen, while the Sega version has a two inch black
bar running along the entire right side of the screen.  Just being
able to see more of the screen adds to the S-NES Zombies, because you
have more time to react to the oncoming enemies.  The graphics are
also larger than those for the Sega version and playing them both
right after each other really shows which is superior.

Not only is the screen size a difference in the two Zombies, but the
music, when compared to each other, is a total blowout with the
S-NES's better sound capabilities destroying the Sega version.  Hooked
up to a stereo system, the Zombies soundtrack booms with some house
shaking bass and some of the better video game sounds on the market
being used.  Real samples of screams and explosions were used to give
a sense of realism to Zombies, while the rest of the game comes off as
a B-movie style game with many cliches being used.

Genesis version - 70

The Sega version of Zombies and I got off to a bad start; I played
Zombies on my S-NES and expected an almost identical version on the
Sega.  I was wrong.  The programmers took a shotty approach in the
making of the Sega version, and I was honestly disappointed with the
whole game.  The two inch black bar is probably the thing that stands
out most as an example of bad programming.  It takes up way to much
room on the screen, and it's only use is to show the score, weapons
left, and a mapping system which shows you where the citizens are; all
of which was done on the regular screen for the S-NES.

Bar aside, the graphics in this game are the same on both versions,
with only a slight color loss on the Sega version being the
difference.  Zombies is not compatible with the six button controller,
which would have been ideal with this type of game.  Assigning
multiple weapons to the top buttons could have added a lot to the game
play.  In the area of sound, the Sega version lacks the same
instrumental quality that the S-NES Zombies had, and the sound effects
seemed to be shorter with a scratchy digitized sound that accompanied
them.  I can understand how the music might be below the S-NES
standards, but allowing the Genesis Zombies to be plagued by a huge
bar really brought this game down.


   Here's How They Stacked Up HEAD TO HEAD :

Overall, the concept and ideas for Zombies showed a lot of originality
on both versions, and the two player option adds a lot to the
re-playability of this game.  But when put side to side, the S-NES
version really outperforms the Sega Zombies in both playability and
overall appearance.  Unlike Mortal Kombat where the Genesis version
had the blood where the S-NES one didn't, the Sega Zombies has no
superior qualities over it's S-NES counterpart, and people who are
interested in buying this game will easily pick up a copy of the Super
Nintendo version over the Sega Genesis version.

Hello all of you GMJers.  If you want to write to us letting us know
what you think of the new version, old version, how much you hate us
or love us, or have any video game questions that you hope to be
published, write to us at the addresses above.  We are trying to set
up ID's for ALL of our writers on these boards, but until we do, just
write to the ID's above.  Everyone sees every letter.  This edition of
Express Mail, we only selected letters strictly magazine related since
the theme seems to be our new version.  Since some of the questions
were really good, we thought it would be a good and simple way to
explain exactly how everything will work.  However, keep sending your
game questions and other such mail because next issue will resume
regular procedures...

*** Slow baud? No problem.
I was on Prodigy and I read some promotional letters from you guys
about the graphic version of the magazine.  I assume it is a big file
and I only have a 2400 modem.  Is there another way to get the new
version?

H. Cavelerio
Westford, Ma

{ Phunky: Just recently we decided to give away the magazine through
{ the mail in addition to the downloads.  All you have to do is write
{ us on any of our boards in which we read mail.  Give us your
{ address and we will send you the print issues monthly.

*** Win-dozer
Why is your new version only for windows? I don't have windows and I
have been with you guys almost the whole time! Now you exclude me?
THANKS A LOT!

Norman Lewis
Boston, Ma

{ Phunky:
{ Hey Norm, CALM DOWN! We reconfigured the whole project.  At first it
{ was only going to be for windows, but we found some better ways of
{ doing the mag.  Now anyone with a PC can view our mag through DOS!

*** But, you aren't EGM!
GMJ rules, don't get me wrong.  But we need some overseas coverage.  I

*** Recent fan wants pictures
I've been a follower of your mag ever since issue #23, and I've seen
great improvements in both the layout and overall quality of the
reviews.  Your info is out months before the other published mags, so
I really don't have a reason to buy them anymore.  The only problem I
see is that you can't have pictures of the games online.  Other than
that, GMJ is my favorite video gaming mag on and it's free!! Keep up
the good work.

Hey SFII fans, it's renew your lease on your Genesis...AGAIN! Quite
possibly one of the most amazing feats accomplished on the Genesis so
far is the latest version of SFII from Capcom.  Every year, you think
that the good old Genny is just a little too outdated, but bang,
programming hits a new level and you keep it for another year.  Games
like SFIISCE keep Sega players happy, and the video game market going.

Judging by the name, you may think it is just the Champion Edition
standing alone, however just like on the SNES, the Turbo and Hyper
Fighting options are included.  But unlike the SNES version, the Sega
version packs a tournament option.

When you first snag this cart of the shelf and plug it in to your
Genesis, there is simply nothing that is going to fully prepare you
for what you are going to experience.  Every last animation is here,
perfectly translated to the Sega format.  Choose from any of the 12
characters in either of their snazzy uniforms (depending what mode you
are playing in).  The backgrounds amazingly enough look spectacular
even in the 64 color display.  The smooth parallax scrolling,
simulating 3D effect and the soft textured presentation of the
characters are only a small part of this flickerless phenomenon.

Anyone planning on picking this cart up, should really consider buying
one of Sega's little 6 button controllers to go with it.  Not only
does the controller give you true arcade control for a great price
($20), but it is also the best available controller on the market
priced under $40.  With the 6 button controller, this is the best
playing version of the game yet.  Too bad this game was not made
compatible with Sega's upcoming 4 player adapter, the tournament mode
would have fit so perfectly.

The tournament mode is a great opportunity for you and your buddies to
get together and find out who the real champ is.  There are 2 tourney
options.  The first one allows each person competing to select 6
different fighters to use.  Whoever wins the most matches is obviously
the winner.  This mode is great to show up those 1 dimensional players
who can only use one or two characters.  The second mode, the
Elimination Mode, allows to select from one to six characters.  You
fight one round battles and whoever defeats all their opponents first
wins.

If speed is what you need, you will be exuberantly excited to find out
that just like the SNES version, this version is actually faster than
the arcade since you can choose from a total of ten speeds (no code
necessary this version).

Ahh, there had to be one downer.  The voices.  Although the music is
pretty good the voices and sound effects were completely horrible.  A
disappointing con since we have seen a lot of great effects and sounds
on other previous Genny carts.  I assume this was all due to lack of
memory.  Even at 24 meg, they ran out of room to improve on the sound,
but that is ok because the rest of the game is near perfect.

It's finally here folks.  Many thought it would never come, but it did
and in a big way.  SFIISCE is one of the hottest carts this year on
the Genesis with amazing graphics, control and speed.  Only thing I
can say that is wrong with it besides the sound, is that it was based
on the SNES version, not the arcade.  The characters are small just
like on the SNES and they did not truly add the Turbo
backgrounds...however, this is GENESIS!

        Here's how they stacked up HEAD TO HEAD:

For some nitty gritty comparisons, you should check out our review
last issue of the SNES version, but here are some of the points we
came up with.

o The Genesis version is just as fast with no code needed.
o The characters are animated just as well, and graphics are just as
  spectacular.
o The SNES version has a much brighter and colorful appearance and
  that is hands down a big plus.
o The sound on the SNES version is great, the voices are ok, but the
  both the sound and voices on the Genny version rotted!
o The control was great on both versions.  With the 6 button
  controller, the Genesis version played better.  Using the 3 button
  controller, the SNES version played better.  The music was really
  good on both version, but I have to give the SNES version the edge.
o Both versions offer small characters, and unfinished backgrounds.
o The Genesis version offers a great tournament mode not found on any
  other version.

Ranger-X represents what an older concept along with newer technology
can create and along with it a new realm in video gaming.  Space
shooters have been used time and time again, but Ranger-X from Gao (a
new Sega development team) twists the idea along with a side scrolling
shooter to make a game that is actually original in today's market.

Your character is a huge metal suited figure, equipped with a standard
blaster and a second weapon which can be switched at any time in the
game.  This second weapon has it's own power meter which drops when
it's being used.  An Ex-Up vehicle follows along behind you and can
become a part of you by standing on it and pressing down to crouch
inside the vehicle.  While on the Ex-Up you can choose what your
second weapon is from an assortment of lasers to a flame thrower.  The
Ex-Up automatically follows your character throughout the level, and
with the six button controller, you can control it by using the top
buttons.

Flying is a big part of this game as your main guy can take to the air
because of the engine hooked up to your back.  The engine is limited
to just a few seconds of flying, but with practice, hovering in one
place can make it so you're in the air for longer periods of time.
Your character and the other motorized attackers all animate very
fluidly on screen, and the amount of color and parallax scrolling on
the levels in incredible.  Each level has you going after a series of
targets that must be destroyed before going onto the boss encounter.
Some levels have you going on one set path, while others like level
two have you exploring certain areas to find the targets.

The button combinations are unique in that button A makes you face
left and let's you fire in that direction, while button C faces you
right.  Button B uses the special weapon and up takes you to the
skies.  The backgrounds in this game all use a tremendous amount of
color, and the foregrounds and sprites all use color effectively.  The
explosions are realistic looking, which is a given for a shooter style
game.  The popular use of parallax found in the floor of the Street
Fighter II levels can be found here in level three with a 3-D tunnel
that looks like you're really walking past it.  This might not add
much to the actual game, but it's great for the visual aspect of the
game.

The music is some phunky tunes that fit into this game perfectly.
Listening to this game with a pair of headphones really adds to the
game because it makes you feel like you're in the game.  The
explosions shake the house literally, and the gunfire is represented
with realistic digitized sounds.  Other newsworthy portions of this
game include some software scaling of some enemy ships and at the
beginning of each level a series of lines that represent building
scales and rotates around the screen and scale toward the viewer.

The downsides of Ranger-X include the very hard nature of the game and
the awkward controls that take time to master and to feel comfortable
with.  The good points are the great graphics and presentation of the
levels and the overwhelming sounds that happen during the action.  The
addition of the Ex-Up really improves the game-play of the game, and
the bosses and enemies all seem to come at you at once.  Ranger-X has
some great strategic levels, and is a game for the hard core gamer
that can beat most games on hard.  Along with Gunstar Heroes, Sega
seems to be focusing a lot of attention on action games now-a-days
which means we'll be seeing a lot of good quality games come Christmas
time.  Ranger-X is just superb.

Sr. Jnx-90
The sights and sounds in Ranger-X just blew me away! The Ex-Up rover
was a great idea that can be used as an option in future games.  The
scaling lines in-between levels weren't needed, and the difficulty was
just too hard for most gamers.

Mr. Mojo Risin'-92
This game just simply rocks!! Everything is perfect from the huge
amount of colors to the great sound effects.

Leave all your premonitions and beliefs of what your Sega Genesis can
do in the closet, because Sega has probably destroyed every boundary
of what the Genesis is "supposed to do" in it's newest game, Gunstar
Heroes.  Gunstar is in a league of it's own; never before have a
combination of graphics, sound, game-play, software techniques, and
overall fun been all applied to the same game with such magnitude.

Gunstar Heroes is the newest side-scrolling action game to be released
on the Genesis, and while not having the popular movie names to it or
any flashy ad campaigns, has succeeded in mixing the perfect blend of
non-stop action and game-play into one 8-meg cart.  The on-screen
action can only be described as furious, with as many as ten enemies
on screen at once, and clocked at speeds just under a weighted down
Sonic.  Enemies come from everywhere, and attack from just about every
point of angle on the screen.

At the beginning of the game you get to choose your characters
fighting style; either being able to fire your weapon as you run or an
option that makes you have to stand still while you fire your weapon.
Next, you get to choose which of the four beginning levels you'll
start out at, and then a quick rundown on the level you chose.  From
here on out is non-stop action that has to be seen to be believed.

There are four primary weapons in Gunstar: a laser, a fire thrower, a
seek and destroy weapon, and a flame thrower.  The weapons are spread
out all around the levels and can be upgraded by finding and picking
up that weapons icon.  An original idea used in this game is that the
weapons can be mixed so that a brand new weapon is made (ie.  if you
pick up the fire thrower and the tracking weapon, the weapon becomes a
huge line of flame that seeks out enemies.) This new weapon set-up
makes for some great trial and error situations where you must decide
which weapon must be used in what situation.

Scaling and rotation have never looked this good on the Sega Genesis.
Through software techniques, almost flawless rendering of objects is
possible.  Most of the bosses use at least some special technique in
the way they attack or more around the screen.  One such boss is a
series of boxes in the form of a human figure which rotates around the
screen and has the most lifelike movements that I've ever seen in a
box.  The rest of the graphics in this game are cartoonish in nature,
but are done with superb color usage and some great animations.  A lot
of detail went into the making of this game, with great shading and
backgrounds on all of the levels, and a lot of attention in keeping
the action intense at all points in the game.

The first four levels can be beaten in any order, and doing so is no
cake walk.  Each level has several mini-bosses and an end boss that
makes you use all the skills of the character.  Your character can
shoot in any direction, be it up, down, sideways, or in any diagonal
direction.  Your character can also do a slide sweep which takes a lot
of damage off the enemies, and a combination of a throw or a body
slam/jump kick.  Hanging from ceilings and ledges is also possible,
and aerial throws and combinations are also possible.  Two of the
levels have you riding in a separate vehicle; one being in a scooter
that can defy gravity, and the other one in a spaceship for a mini
outer space shooter.  Game-play has never reached these heights, with
an improvement only possible with the use of a six button capability
not found in this game.  The levels themselves also have unique things
to cling from and to climb on.  One level is set on an aircraft in the
sky while another is a huge monopoly game with multiple baddies to
beat up on.  Older twists such as reappearing bosses has also been
used so that the boss count in this game is over fifteen guys.

Games with great graphics or a lot software techniques usually end up
having one area of the game being less than standard.  This is not
true with Gunstar though, because the music and sounds in this game
are THE best I've ever heard on the Genesis.  The background music
pounds out some hard rock tunes while the on screen action is heard
with some heart stopping explosions and non-stop gunfire.  Every
action has it's own sound effect so your neighbors may complain that
there's a war going on in your bedroom.

One feature that I didn't mention above is that Gunstar is a two
player game also.  After testing it out though, we found that some
slow down was found in some levels because of it, but not enough to
hurt the game in any way.  To add to the replay value, Gunstar has the
perfect difficulty curve that actually affects the attacks of the
enemies (ie.  on easy, there are several "spots" where you can stand
when fighting a boss and not get hurt, but while on the other settings
you can get hurt anywhere.) To me, Gunstar is almost the perfect game.
Everything is done to perfection, with action unequaled in any
earlier attempts at a side-scrolling action game, and that is as fun
to watch as it is to be playing.  Hopefully, more games will be made
with this being the game to match in overall quality and
professionalism.  Goods news for us though, because this game is just
screaming sequel.

Phunky Pheel One-96 Wow!
This game sets new standards for video games in general.  Not only are
the graphics some of the best, but the sounds and playability are up
there with other classics like Contra and Mega Man.  To bad the
creators of this game are working on a McDonalds game and not a sequel
to Gunstar Heroes!

Anderson-90
Gunstar Heroes shows that with a lot of programming a game can surpass
the expectations of a system.  I couldn't believe the amount of action
on screen at once.  The two player adaption was a great addition to a
game that needs no improvements and has the best moves this side of
Street Fighter.

Pepperidge Farmer-97
Perfect man, perfect! I've been playing this game non-stop ever since
the GMJ offices got it in.  The many smiles this game gave me is worth
the price, no prob.  One or two more levels would have made this game
a 100.

*** NEWS D70 ***

GENESIS NEWZ CLIP:
Redo it! The preliminary version of Tournament Fighters from Konami on
the Genesis looked pathetic, however after retooling and refining
backgrounds and animation, the Genny version is starting to look up.
The hyped up Eternal Champions from Sega is one of the best looking
games for the holidays.  The new texture techniques used will be
making this one of the most impressive graphical displays on the
Genesis EVER!

...by, Da Phunky Pheel One, Ace, Sr. Jnx and others...

Welcome back all to another exciting issue.
This issue we are featuring 2 special reviews of games that appear on
both the SNES and Genesis.  If you have trouble deciding which
version of a game to get, GMJ will now be doing side by side
comparisons of any game that appears on 2 or more systems.  Next
issue you can look forward to over 15 reviews and a special
Electronic Arts insert reviewing ALL the four way play games, as well
as 2 3DO reviews.

Macromdeia announced recently to develop a player which would allow
Director Macintosh or Windows files to be compatible on the 3DO.
This is the first bid to direct the 3DO as a business utility and not
just a video game console.  Marketing the 3DO directly to compete
with Macs and PC's would certainly strenghten the list of pros for
the 3DO as we here at GMJ are not very convinced that the 3DO is
strictly a video game unit.

In Segaland there is many a rumor flying around about the Saturn.
Sega may ditch the old format and hop right on to a 64 bit project
with the same title which would be a CD based unit that would play
Sega CD format games as well as regular Genesis titles.  Our source
for this rumor was very bleak so that is all we can say right now.
If we find any backbone or followup information to that story, you
will be updated...But for what we CAN tell you right now not to
expect this super system until late '94.  At the earliest.

Any Genesis owner who feels depribed for some reason that only SNES
players will be enjoying the horrible SFII/MK ripoff, Clayfighters
can rejoyce.  Interplay, makers of the SNES game Clayfighters has
singed on to the Sega 3rd party crew with a Genesis version of
Clayfighters.

Some possible last second changes to Sonic CD might be a replacement
of the cinema scenes.  We hate to throw another rumor at you but we
have to.  The grapevine has it that the current cinemas to Sonic CD
will be replaced by segments of the Saturday version of the cartoon.
As long as they don't delay the game because of this, I don't care,
otherwise...WHY?!?!

All of you Sega/health freaks (and those two things are just so
complimantary of each other) can have fun with an upcoming excersise
unit from the company Hearbeat.  This unit plugs into the Genesis
control port and its directional controls are hooked up to an
exersise bike (provided by you).  You setup a workout which will be
interactive with a game.  The concept of the packin game (Outback
Joey) is to go through levels and fight off bad guys while mantaining
a certain heart rate.  There may also be an NHL game in development
for this unique attachment...?

Nearly three weeks ago the long awaited Panasonic 3DO multimedia unit
was released nationwide for a retail of $700.  Available for our
hands on test was one pack-in game wad Crash and Burn - a futuristic
racing game.  For what we had been expecting, believe it or not some
at GMJ were somewhat disappointed.  Before you decide to stop reading
our magazine forever though, hear me out.  The scaling, graphics and
manipulation of the objects and backgrounds was incredible, however
the movement and interaction with the car and backgrounds was poorly
done.  Then we thought it was not fair to judge a first title so
strictly, and when compared to say an Altered beast or Super Mario
World (in ratio), it is needless to say that Crash and Burn is a
king.

I was disappointed in the marketing of this unit.  Thrown in every
video game section of every store, the 3DO is now directed as a way
too expensive video game unit, instead of a next wave multimedia
entertainment business and networking unit and possibly the
replacement for VCR and alternate to an expensive PC that it is.
Instead of packing the unit with a keyboard or control panel, the
system is packed with a video game controller and the "bare" system
is not fully capable of running full length full motion video discs.
A special cartridge upgrade has to be installed.  These are all some
major mistakes because at $700 no one is purchasing this system so
they can play Madden football...and if they are, they got some
problems.

Ok, so you are all thinking how bad we are dogging this unit.  NO NO
NO! Not at all.  I am convinced this will be the entertainment unit
of the future hands down.  The possibilities of the 3DO are endless.
We just thought that their marketing approach was all wrong.  Why
should I spend $700 that is not loaded with some of the standard
features it was supposed to COME with when in 9 months another 3DO
system will be released for $500 with internal full motion
capabilities, a keyboard, and a mouse?

Let there be no mistake.  This IS the future of entertainment.  This
is a video game system, interactive TV, fax machine, VCR and more all
in one unit.

Check out next issue where we will give you a FULL coverage report
and review the games.

Lets get right to the chase gang, this is one HELL of a game! The
game that started the craze, Street Fighter, has it's third upgrade
now, this time with new everything! 4 new characters, redrawn
graphics, re-sampled sounds...  it's all here! NEW MOVES TOO!

Unless you have lived in a CAVE for the last 30 months, you know that
the object of Street Fighter is to beat your foe in a
two-out-of-three falls match.  There are SIXTEEN characters to choose
from, each with their own fighting style.  Some throw fireballs, some
are great with their hands while others are blazing fast.  It is up
to you to find a character that best macthes your playing style.

You play against 12 of the 16 characters when you play against the
computer, and the first 11 are randomly selected.  The final
character you face is M.Bison, the evil druglord/dictator of Thailand
who has spread his evil world-wide.

When someone else puts their credits in the machine, the game goes
into a head-to-head mode.  You then must fight to stay on the machine
because the loser goes home!

One of the Game of the Year candidates, this one will blow you away!

Ace - 95
The ONLY problem I had with this game was the fact that the sounds,
although they sound GREAT with Q-sound, are AWEFULLY DONE! This
sounds like a NEO*GEO game! But other than that..  LOOK OUT!

====================================================================
                             WARP ZONE!
====================================================================

SUPER STREET FIGHTER MOVES:  All of the new ones BEFORE EGM,
                             GamePro, VG + Die Hard Game Fan.

NOTE: Although this LOOKS like some posts on the Internet, this is
      NOT a 'steal', we did find these moves, these are OUR strat's
      and all of these moves are listed correctly.  (IF not, tell
      us, and we'll fix it!)


====================================================================
Cammy
====================================================================
Special Moves:
Spear kick:           |  \  --o  +  kick
                      o   o

Spinning Backhand: /  |  \  +  punch
                  o   o   o

Crescent Kick:  --o  |  \  + kick
                     o   o

Pile-driving Suplex (Pileplex):  --o  +  fierce kick
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Back Suplex: --o  +  fierce punch
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Ariel Throw:  --o  +  medium kick

Comments:
Spear Kick: Cammy launxhes herself horizontally, close to the ground,
at the opponent.  This is actually her worst move, but it can be used
it combos very easily.  The only problem with it is that it has
horrible recovery time.  This can be dealt with by doing the short
spear kick from the limit of its range so that while your opponent is
recovering from the block, you can be recovering from the kick.  It
also places you at the maximum distance from the opponent.  It also
only goes about half way across the screen before stopping.  It can
be used to stop projectiles like Blanka and Honda, but it is best
used as a defensive maneuver.

Spinning Backhand: This looks like a quick spin followed by a guile
backhand.  It has the capability of hitting twice, and when it does
it does a great deal of damage.  Secondly, when Cammy is spinning on
her heals she is invincible.  But you have to have perfect timing,
since you are vulnerable before and after this point.  It can be used
like Balrog's TAP to dodge fireballs, but it is more difficult to
time.  Because you move so far forward, you will probably want to use
the jab spinning backhand, otherwise you will end up within sweeping
distance.  The move is fairly slow, but if used correctly, deadly.

Crescent Kick: This is basically a dragon punch with her foot, and it
is her best move.  It has a trajectory that is wider than Ken's
fierce DP, and it is also invincible (except against Ken/Ryu's Dragon
Punch) while going up.  The intital frames are vulnerable, though, so
it cant be used exactly like the DP.

Combos:
    If Ken or Ryu throw a fireball, do the following...
      Spinning Backhand, short kick, Crescent Kick (3 to 5 hit combo)
    If Guile shows Sonic Boom or Dee Jay shows Ace rusher, do...
      Spinning Backhand, Crescent Kick (2 to 4 hit combo)

Overall:
Cammy is one of the best new characters in the game, according to
most people.  She has good speed and air-priority to rival Chun Li.
She seems to be played in the same style as Chun Li, but with the
added advantage of the uppercut-like kick.  She is great at anti-air
defense, also.

====================================================================
T-Hawk
====================================================================
Special Moves:

Mexican Typhoon:        full 360 degrees on joystick + punch
(aka Phi Slamma Jamma)  (like zangief's spinning pile driver)

Condor Dive:  Jump + (all three punches)

Tomahawk Buster:   --o  |  \  +  punch
                        o   o

Face Smash:   --o + fierce punch

Face Chop:   --o + roundhouse

Throw:  medium punch

Comments:
Mexican Typhoon: Hawk grabs you, plams your head like a basketball,
jumps in the air, windmills you in the air 720 degress, then slams
you into the ground head first.  If you want to impress the hell out
of everyone around you, this is the move to do.  It has a pretty
decent range, about the length for dahlsim to throw.

Condor Dive: T-Hawk jumps, then suddenly dives at you like dahlsim's
yoga spear.  This move can be deceptive - try jumping back, then
diving with the condor dive.  It has a good range, but can only be
done on the way up, not on the way down.  It can be useful for
countering fireballs.

Tomahawk Buster: Another version of the DP, but this goes more
diagonal and is not as quick.  It is only invincible for a very short
time at the beginning, then the rest is vulnerable.  The fierce TB
extends really far - farther than ken's DP - and can also hit twice
if close enough.  It has a pretty nasty fall distance, so it can be
risky.  But the delay when you reach the ground is minimal.

Combos:
Roundhouse neck kick- standing forward- fierce tomahawk buster.

The tick standing short - into mexican typhoon seems to work, but not
as well as Zangief's.

Overall:
T-Hawk seems to be a very versatile character.  His biggest weakness
is his speed, but that can be made up for by his big moves.  His
spinning leg sweep is also a nice move, and it executes faster than
Guile's fierce trip.  His kicks have decent range - much better than
Ken, Ryu, Zangief, and Chun Li's, i would say.  His standing forward
is really nice - it has about a Ryu crouching roundhouse range,
sticks out straight, and is fast.

====================================================================
Dee-Jay
====================================================================
Special Moves:

Machine Gun Upper:   |  o  +  (punch, punch, punch...)
                     o  |

Ace Rusher:  --o  +  punch
             (charge)

Hop Step and a Kick:     o--   --o  +  kick
                       (charge?)

Dee Jay Escape:    | + roundhouse kick
                   o
Comments:
Machine Gun Upper: If you hit the button once, you get a jab-like
uppercut.  Tapping a punch button repeatedly after executin the move
will extend the punch further.  It works well as a defensive move, as
it will stop most characters from jumping in.  It is difficult to hit
more than a few times, but it has been done up to four.

Ace Rusher: This looks and works like guile's sonic boom, but is
different because it has a long recovery time and his body leans way
forward when performing it.

Hop Step and a Kick: He sort of kicks, turns around, and kicks again.
Crouching Roundhouse: This is like dahlsim's slide.  It can be used
against someone who is jumping in at you, but unfortunately it cant
go under fireballs.  If the timing is right, you can follow up a
fireball with this.

Combos:
   jumping hit - standing forward - fireball
   jumping hit - standing short - short spinning kick

Overall:
Dee Jay seems to be one of the better characters and will be
especially useful to those who know how to use Guile.  His far
standing fierce is a good anty-air attack, and his jump + roundhouse
hits far enough down to hit Dahlsim's crouching fierce.  His jumps
are his biggest flaw.  The lower part of his body hangs really low,
which makes it hard to jump over fireballs.  Fireball traps seem to
work very well against him, since jumping is difficult and he lacks
any invincible move.

====================================================================
Fei Long
====================================================================

Special Moves:

Triple Punch:   |  \  --o  +  punch (repeat,
                o   o                repeat...)

Flaming Vertical Kick:   o--  |   /  +  kick
                              o  o

Leaping Double Kick:   --o  +  roundhouse

Flip-over throw:   --o +  roundhouse
     [ THROWING DISTANCE ONLY ]

Comments:
Triple Punch: Doing the fireball motion once will give you a flaming
jab.  Doing it again quickly will cause him to slide forward a bit
and follow up with a straight punch.  A third time finishes the move
with another punch.  He rushes at you faster than Balrog's rushing
punches, but it is hard to get the timing right to get multiple hits.
Practice makes perfect!

Flaming Kick: He jumps into the air with his leg on fire.  The
horizontal range is non-existant.  The height is determined by which
kick you use.  It is a bit safer than a dragon punch because if you
do it too soon, you might be in a defensive crouch.  If you do it too
late, you will still be blocking.  It seems to be mainly a defensive
move.

Leaping Kick: Fei Long jumps at you with a double kick.  It does
pretty decent damage.  Although he spends a lot of time moving
forward with no attack out, once the attack comes out it has one hell
of a priority.

Combos:
This combo is great against the larger characters (Zangief, Hawk)
Jumping roundhouse, short kick, Triple punch over + over

Overall:
He has the potential to be the next anti-character, like Guile was
for Ken/Ryu.  Use him against characters without projectiles for the
best chance of victory.

===================================================================
Ryu
===================================================================
Dragon Punch: --o | \  + punch
                  o  o

   Still the superior move in the game.  Deadly, but not as damaging.

Red Fireball:   o--  /  |  \  --o  +  punch
                    o   o   o
This is a red fireball that will burn the opponent like Dhalsim's
yoga fire.

Fireball:  | \  --o + punch
           o  o

He has a longer delay after his fireball and his hurricane kick now
starts spinning on the way up and all the way down, following his
jump motion.

Hurricane Kick: |  / o-- + kick
                o o
Air Hurricane Kick: Jump then HK motion

The kick still does tons of damage.  the Air HK now follows the
motion of his normal jump (arced).  The sooner you do the HK motion
during your jump, the higher you'll fly.

====================================================================
Ken
====================================================================
Changes to his DP - fierce now burns opponent and can hit 3 times.
Jab hits once and knocks down.  His hurricane kick is also like
Ryu's.  Does not have a flaming fireball..  but other than that, see
Ryu.

==============================================================================
Chun Li
==============================================================================
Fireball:   o--   --o  +  punch
         (charge)

The new fireball.
ONLY use in a situation where your opponent will definitely either be
hit (like in a combo) or will have to block (such as when an opponent
is just getting up).  The delay AFTER the fireball is even longer
than the delay in HF and the fireball (actually, it looks like a raw
egg being tossed) dissipates (dissapears) before crossing the screen.
The faster the fireball, the shorter the distance.

Helicopter Kick: | (charge) o + kick
                 o          |

The altered Helicopter kick
MUCH better against opponents jumping in, as the animation sequence
where Chun is just beginning to flip over now knocks the opponent
down (doesn't leave them standing to retaliate).  Works great vs.
Ken/Ryu, and Long.  Haven't tried it vs.  anyone else yet.  Her
aerial Helicopter (where she goes into it quickly after jumping) is
strange, but I imagine helpfull against corner traps, as it arcs in
the path of her natural jump, and goes by kinda fast.  This is one of
the more important positive changes made.

Combos:
jumping hit - standing fierce - fireball/lightning kick jumping neck
fierce - standing strong - standing fierce - lightning kick jumping
fierce - standing strong - crouching forward.

==============================================================================
Zangief
==============================================================================
Zangief's Power Moves:  360 spin from forward to down
                        and back around to front and....

    punch       -- old faithful, the SPD (spinning pile driver)
    kick        -- charge throw, or CPD (charge pile driver)
    kick (close)-- drop then flip and leap into air with them,
                       or FPD (flip pile driver)

Knee Drop:  o (hold) + fierce
            |

     No more one-hit dizzy.

Air Throws: He has TWO air throws
    fierce (and forward)--almost exactly like Z's old crouch strong throw,
       but in the air.
    roundhouse (and forward)--almost exactly like his old crouch fierce, but
       in the air--nabs them and with no pause heaves them in the air over
       his shoulder (doesn't look up like he did before)

Throws: finally got all but one normal throw checked out.
         Strong--simple pile driver from before.
         Fierce--iron claw aka far+strong from older versions
        Forward--new suplex ala fierce from older versions--heaves opponent
                 over head, then falls back, but this time he ends up
                 horizontal about 1 inch from the ground, and then you fall
down.
     Roundhouse--chin smash ala far+fierce from before
  crouch fierce--gut wrench as older versions.


==============================================================================
Blanka
==============================================================================
Blanka Ball: o--  --o + punch
          (charge)

  Still one of the fastest moves in the game.

Vertical Ball: | (charge) o + kick
               o          |

Flip Roll:  o--   --o  +  kick
        (charge)

Blanka flips back, then does a roll that has an arc to it.  If timed
right, it can go over fireballs.

He is improved in someways, DIES in others.  He now stops rolling in
his vertical roll and goes back down at an angle so he cant be swept
or dragon punched so easily.  Also, the timing of his rolls are such
that, if blocked, a quick fireball will hit it on the way down.

====================================================================
Honda
====================================================================
Thousand Hand Slap: Punch buttons over and over

   Great for corner-trapping.

Banzai Drop: | (charge) o + kick
             o          |

==============================================================================
Guile
==============================================================================
Sonic Boom:  o--  --o + punch
           (charge)

   An ever BETTER recovery than before!

Flash Kick (aka Razor Kick):  | (charge) o + kick
                              o          |

  The range for this has been dropped a bit.  More defensive now.

Mid-Air Back Breaker: --o + punch

Pretty good priority.  Watch out for mis-timing..  you need to be
almost touching to pull the move off.

====================================================================
Dhalsim
====================================================================
Dhalsim Disappear:
   --o | \  + punch  OR o-- |  / + punch
       o  o   kick          o o    kick

Either forward DRP will put you in front of your foe, either backward
will put you behind him or her.  Punch = far away, kick = near.

Fireball: | \  --o + punch
          o  o

   Just as good as Ken and Ryu's!

Yoga Flame: o-- / | \  --o
               o  o  o

   This hangs around for a LONG while!

====================================================================
Balrog
====================================================================
Buffalo Headbutt:   |   o  +  punch
                    o   |
               (charge)
   Yet another variation on the DP.

Charge Punch: o-- --o + punch = straight
               (charge) kick  = uppercut

Turn Around Punch: HOLD ALL 3 KICK then let go

This move no longer lets you go through fireballs.

Here's the bottom line:
        Power DOWN.

Against anyone w/o a fireball, Balrog will roast 'em.  Easy.
Against anyone WITH a fireball, well, you're gonna have to work.  And
hard.

Overall, he's still a power to face.... if you use him, good luck.

====================================================================
Vega
====================================================================
Air Spiral:   |  o  or o +  punch
              o   \   /
          (charge)
Vega jumps off the wall like he is going to do a claw dive, but then
dives head first across the screen in mid air.  He picks the wall
depending on where you point (up-left or up-right.)

Spread Eagle: |    o +  punch
              o    |
            (charge)

Wall Dive - Suplex: |          o  + kick, then PUNCH when near
                    o (charge) |                     your foe.

====================================================================
Sagat
====================================================================
Tiger Shots:  | \  --o + punch = high Tiger Shot
              o  o       kick  = low Tiger Shot

Tiger Uppercut: --o | \  + punch
                    o  o
                 o
Tiger Knee: / | /  + kick
           o  o

  About the only change is that his tiger knee now goes further.

====================================================================
Bison
====================================================================
Flying Dive:  |  o  +  punch
              o  |
          (charge)
He jumps really high and then comes down and hits you on the head
with his fist.

Anti-Grav Kick: |  o +  kick
                o  |
              (charge)

Still defies gravity with this jump, after it hits you can attack
again in mid-air!

Bison Torpedo :      o--    --o + punch
(aka Psycho Chrusher) (charge)

   Only hits at MOST 3 times.

  Scissor Kick: o--  --o + kick
            (charge)

   Always a knock-down move!
